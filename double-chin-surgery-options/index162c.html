<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>It’s not unusual for patients to have concerns about the aesthetic appearance of their chin,  jawline and neck. These concerns are usually related to skin laxity, neck fat, muscle abnormalities and deficiencies of the underlying bones.</p><p>The type of procedure performed to correct these problems is entirely dependent upon the anatomic cause of the condition. Without a physical exam it’s impossible to know with certainty which option is best for you.</p><p>If problem is related to excess fat in neck, liposuction of the neck is probably best treatment option.

</div>For these reasons neck liposuction is probably best treatment option. If you’re considering this procedure it’s important to consult a board certified plastic surgeon.
<p>This surgeon should be able to formulate an appropriate treatment plan. </p><h3> double chin and excess fat removal in the neck</h3><p>If there is excess fat hanging in the neck beneath the chin and neck lift would need to be performed on patient’s less than 50 years of age or a face/ neck lift on patient’s over 50 years of age due to the skin tone issue and an elastic skin.</p><p>The neck lift involves removal of fat above and below the platysma muscle and a platysma-plasty to defined jawline.

</div>If all you have is fat under the chin, you would not need a facelift, which is designed for wrinkled, excess, or sagging chin and facial musculature. 
<p>Chin liposuction works beautifully in patients with localized fat deposits under the chin with low cost and speedy recovery.</p><p>If you have signs of facial aging, then a facelift should not be considered right now. (Robert L. Kraft, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Liposuction or Facelift?</h5><p>The answer depends on several factors including your age, skin tone, and presence/absence of changes to the platysma muscle. Often, what is perceived by the patient as fat under the chin is a multifactorial problem that is more associated with the changes of aging than fat excess.</p><p>Neck liposuction would be more typically performed on a 30 something year old patient and a Face/Neck-Lift would be more typical in an individual age 50 and up. (Stephen Prendiville, MD, Fort Myers Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>For a younger person (30’s and sometimes early 40’s) with excellent skin elasticity, liposuction is an great option for excess fat in the jowls. Once you get into your 40’s and 50’s, skin elasticity decreases and liposuction will often leave you with sagging, empty skin.
<p>Think deflated balloon look. This is true whether liposuction is done with a laser or any other device. Remember, it’s not the tool but the skin properties. In my practice, in virtually 100% of the facelift’s I perform, we do liposuction in the neck and jowls.</p><p>Liposuction helps to elevate the skin from the underlying fat, a necessary step during a facelift, and it helps maximize your results. There is no additional charge for liposuction at the time of a facelift. (John Bitner, MD, Salt Lake City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

<em>For just fat under chin Laser Liposuction is your best option</em><p>If you only have fat under your chin with no significant neck skin laxity or Platysma Muscle Banding, then Laser Liposuction is your best option. Since the area of fat under then chin is small and thin skinned, the tiny laser fiber melts the fat and allows very small cannulae or tubes to be used to remove the liquefied fat.</p><p>Smaller instrumentation is preferable under the chin and on the neck in an effort to leave smooth skin after the procedure. The Laser Liposuction using SlimLipo also helps tighten the skin after the fat has been removed.</p><p>If your main problem is sagging neck skin under the chin or bands of skin hanging under the neck then a Neck Lift or Facelift will probably be required.  (Brooke R. Seckel, MD, FACS, Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Laxity of Platysma Contributes to Poor Neck Contour</b></p><p>Liposuction can be very helpful for this problem if it is only fat that is causing the sagging. I find in my practice that in addition to fat, laxity of the platysma muscle also contributes to the poor neck contour.</p><p>In the appropriate case a mini neck lift can deal with the fat and the lax muscle together and can really make a significant improvement in the neck line. Of course in the older patient a traditional facelift is often required to give the most comprehensive result. (Thomas Buonassisi, MD, Vancouver Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Liposuction of the chin vs. a face lift</h4><p>If your issue is excess fat, then most likely, chin liposuction under local anesthetic will do. If you have an excessive amount of fat and/or lax skin about the neck and/or jowls, you should consider a facelift.<br>

</div>There is no substitute for a consultation (or two) in order to get the answer you need. The answers are individual to the patient. (Allan J. Parungao, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)
<p><strong>Fat alone? Then Lipo is OK.</strong> If the skin is tight and there is no muscular laxity, lipo will work well under the chin. Most successful lipo under the chin is in younger patients with solely fatty problems. (John P. Di Saia, MD, Orange Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Chin liposuction can be an excellent option</h3><p>The shape of the neck has several components, skin, fat and underlying muscular shape. If the problem is excess fat with good skin elasticity muscular shape then liposuction can be a wonderful option.</p><p>If there are problems with the shape of the underlying skeleton or significant loss of skin elasticity a neck lift or facelift may be a better option. (York Jay Yates, MD, Salt Lake City Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>For fat under the chin in the absence of any facial laxity, liposuction is the answer to sculpting the chin. Facelifts are for repositioning loose skin on the cheeks and lower face as well as rejuvenating the neck but is a much larger procedure that you need for just neck fat.
<p>Liposuction reduces neck fat and helps to sculpt the chin and neck.(Edgar Franklin Fincher, MD, PhD, Beverly Hills Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>If your only complaint is with your chin then just treat the chin.</h3><p>If your only complaint is with your chin then just treat the chin. I typically use SmartLipo to do this, but not everyone is an ideal candidate. </p><p>Talk to someone that offers neck lifts, as well as SmartLipo and conventional liposuction to see what will give you the best results.</p><p>If you speak to someone that only performs conventional, tumescent liposuction then guess what they will suggest for you? (Richard H. Fryer, MD, Salt Lake City Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Excessive fat under chin must be removed</strong></p><p>Depending of the volume of fat + age, liposuction with skin tightening such as Smartlifting can be performed together. In older patients, examintation for cording must be assessed as this may need tretment as well. Removing it early in life is better as its removal will prevent the early streching of the center neck skin if left. (David A. F. Ellis, MD, Toronto Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Liposuction should nicely correct fat under the chin</h5><p>Liposuction is THE procedure to remove and sculpt fat under the chin. It is a short procedure which is very well tolerated. The recovery requires wearing a support strap to keep the skin against the chin to promote adherence.<br>

</div>Every surgeon has his preferred technique, I prefer the VASER Liposuction / Liposelection which I believe is associated with less swelling, less bruising and better skin shrinking. (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)
<p>If your main concern is only the fat under the chin, liposuction would be the most logical discussion point. You may also need to work on the lower face to maintain the balance of the face, and create natural looking results. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Liposuction of the chin is easy and safe.</h4><p>If the problem with you neck is fat, and only fat, liposuction will yield dramatic results. Most patients are done under local or local with a bit of sedation. The procedue takes about 20 minutes. (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div><h4>Liposuction is an a technique to address localized fat under the chin </h4><p>Liposuction is a technique to address localized fat under the chin. The two most important determinants for a successful result are the quality of the skin and patient compliance. Your best bet is to work with a board-certified plastic surgeon with a great deal of experience with liposuction, facelift, and neck lifts.</p><p>They will be able to evaluate your skin and to determine if you have enough elasticity for the skin to contract after the removal of the underlying fat. If you have good elasticity liposuction is an excellent technique.</p><p></p>

</div>After a Chin liposuction, we routinely tell our patients that they must wear a compressive garment for 24 hours a day for the first two weeks in this area. 
<p>After the period of time they must wear the garment when they return home from work and throughout the evening.</p><p>In a patient who has good quality skin and who follows the postoperative regimen you can expect a great result. (Pat Pazmino, MD, FACS, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Fat under the chin may be helped with liposuction</h5><p>If the fat is just under skin, and not onto the neck, liposuction is perfect. Sometimes, as little as a tablespoon of fat can make a difference. If the fat is onto the neck and the skin is taut, liposuction alone may be effective.</p><p>If the fat is onto the neck and the skin/muscle over it is loose, a necklift or facelift may indeed be required to treat the skin/muscle after the fat is treated by liposuction. (Randy J. Buckspan, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Neck Liposuction for double chin</strong></p><p>Neck liposuction is a surgical procedure that works very well for removal of fullness under the chin that is usually caused by fat. The result depends on the elasticity of the skin. As a general rule, individuals after the age of 45 begin to lose much of the elasticity in their skin; removing fat alone in these individuals would then cause the skin to hang under the chin since it does not have the ability to “spring back”.</p><p>These individuals would need a necklift in addition to liposuction to get the best result. For those individuals who also have jowling of the lower face in addition to lax neck skin or a heavy chin, tightening the neck alone will give them a great neck line but their lower face will look disproportional to their neck; for these patients, a natural facelift, which generally includes a necklift and liposuction in our practice, is what I would recommend. (Mike Majmundar, MD, Atlanta Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Chin lipo depends on the skin</h4><p>Lipo of the chin works amazingly well in the appropriate candidate. This is usually a youger patient who has a tight, fatty bulge and good skin quality. If the skin is loose, lipo might still work, but there is a risk that the skin will not tighten to your satisfaction.</p><p></p>

</div>A skin tightening can be performed at the same time or as a separate stage if you wish. An experienced palstic surgeon can examine your neck and present your best option. (David Shuter, MD, Jupiter Plastic Surgeon)
<p>If you just have excess fat and reasonably good skin tone, you probably only need liposuction of the chin. If the skin is loose, then you probably need a skin tightening procedure as well. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Fat under the chin is best treated first with liposuction</h5><p>Liposuction takes care of the fat under the chin and is so easy to undergo under local anesthesia only and for about $2500. You can later do a neck tuck if you require it but the first step is liposuction in most cases. (David Hansen, MD, Beverly Hills Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction will work in the neck when there is minimal fat deposit and good skin tone with minimal excess skin. In cases with saggy skin, jowls, and neck band, a lower face lift will be needed. (Hisham Seify, MD, PhD, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
