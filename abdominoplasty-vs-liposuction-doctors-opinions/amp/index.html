</div><p>If your abdomen is thin, but the muscles have separated and you have excess skin, the only cure would be an abdominoplasty.</p><p>If, as in most patients you have a mixture of both, you can have a choice. If you have a moderate amount of fat but redundant skin and the separation of muscles, a simultaneous abdominoplasty with often works quite well.</p><p>If your BMI is higher, it is often best to stagger the operations: liposuction first followed by abdominoplasty. Of course these are generalities, you should be evaluated by a proper surgeon. (John E. Sherman, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>The Difference Between Tummy Tuck versus Liposuction</i></p><p>Isolated abdominal contouring using liposuction is most commonly done only in patients that have had minimal fat and usually below the belly button area have not had children. After children, because of the widening of the muscles and the extra skin, liposuction usually does not work as well.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_10963" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>In most cases it is only used as an adjunct especially for liposuction of the flanks, but not of the abdomen. In general, if you have extra skin above and below the belly button a full tummy tuck is in order as well as muscle tightening.</p><p>It is infrequent that a mini tummy tuck is needed unless you have a high umbilicus, a long torso, and have no extra skin above the belly button especially when you sit down. In these selected cases, a mini abdominoplasty works well. (Rod J. Rohrich, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Liposuction vs. tummy tuck- the answer is ‘skin’</h4><p>The answer here is pretty simple- if you’ve got loose abdominal skin, don’t get liposuction. Your skin will become looser. Additionally, if you have a ‘globular’ appearance to your abdomen as a result of abdominal fascial weakness, liposuction will not improve that condition.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_10964" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>A tummy tuck is a powerful procedure that addresses skin laxity, excess fat and abdominal wall laxity. (Scott C. Sattler, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Liposuction vs. tummy tuck: which should I choose?</strong></p><p>Liposuction works well for women with excess fat that has been unresponsive to dieting and exercise–provided that the abdominal skin is not “stretched out” and loose. Liposuction will not tighten the abdominal wall following three pregnancies, so I doubt that you will be “flat.”</p><p>Tummy tuck addresses excess fat, skin laxity, and abdominal wall laxity. Although there are clearly exceptions, women who have had children are more likely to benefit from tummy tuck (which frequently includes liposuction) rather than liposuction alone. (Ronald Friedman, MD, Plano Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Liposuction & Tummy-tuck can go well together</h5><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_10965" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>Liposuction can be an excellent adjunct to a tummy-tuck. By itself, liposuction only removes fat, and skin will contract only so much. If your skin has looseness to it or a roll of excess skin, then you probably need some amount of skin removal as well.</p><p>We also need to tighten the muscles if they have been stretched out with pregnancy or after weight loss. Your plastic surgeon can assess all these things during your consultation and help you determine what treatment is right for you. (Mario Loomis, MD, Middletown Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It all depends on you skin tone, stretch marks, and fatty tissues. The liposuction works well in toned skin with few to no stretch marks. The tummy tick requires more surgery to both remove excess over stretched skin and to tighten abdomenal wall muiscles.</p><p>The tummy tuck requires more healing tiome. (James Apesos, MD, Dayton Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction removes fat and fat only. An abdominoplasty (tummy tuck) removes fat, removes skin, and tightens the abdominal wall. Liposuction works when fat is the only problem. If excess skin and abdominal wall laxity are components, liposuction will not work and an abdominoplasty is indicated. (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction removes unwanted fat deposits. If there is excess skin and/or relaxed underlying muscle after three pregnancies an abdominoplasty (tummy tuck) will be necessary. Liposuction is frequently a part of the tummy tuck procedure. (Richard W. Fleming, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Tummy tucks and liposuction address different issues</strong></p><p>Liposuction is great for recontouring the abdomen when excess fatty tissue with good skin and muscle is the problem. But if pregnancy or weight loss has left you with a loose muscle layer and stretched skin, then an abdominoplasty, or tummy tuck, is the proper operation.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_10967" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>If the fat is extracted without tightening the loose muscle and skin, the abdomen may still bulge and the loose skin might hang over the umbilicus and pubic areas like a deflated water balloon. With any surgery, even cosmetic surgery, reaching the correct diagnosis is essential.</p><p>Therefore it is important to have a consultation with a plastic surgeon who performs both tummy tucks and liposuction so he or she can offer you exactly what you need. A doctor who only can offer liposuction may guide you towards an improper operation. (Bruce E. Genter, MD, FACS, Abington Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>This if often a difficult personal decision to make by the patient. Liposuction will debulk fat, so you can pinch less fat, and provide some moderate retraction to the skin as you heal. It will not change the amount your muscles have spread below your belly button which often gives a big portion of the “pooch” below the umbilicus.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_10968" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

A doctor who only can offer liposuction may guide you towards an improper operation. (Bruce E.

Usually after having babies or losing a lot of weight. Liposuction is performed to remove excess fat, providing a slimming effect and improving shape.</p><p>Many people just need liposuction. This works beautifully if you have tight skin. Of the patients I see who have a Tummy Tuck, about 98% of them choose to have liposuction at the same time to not only get a flatter and tighter stomach, but to also obtain the shape that they have always dreamed of.

If this is the case and if you want to have a very flat, tight tummy, then a tummy tuck is the answer for you.</p><p>Liposuction and muscle tightening can both be done with a tummy tuck. If your skin is tight and smooth then liposuction alone would be a good choice. (Burr von Maur, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Tummy tuck surgery and liposuction serve different purposes</b></p><p>Tummy tuck surgery (abdominoplasty) and liposuction are both procedures used to improve the contours of the body, but serve two different purposes. They are often performed together to achieve the desired result.</p><p>Abdominoplasty is a procedure performed to remove excess skin and tighten the muscles that have been damaged from pregnancy or massive weight gain/loss. Liposuction is a procedure performed to remove unwanted excess fat. When performed together, your plastic surgeon can create a smooth, flattering contour.</p><p>If you are just concerned about excess fat on your lower abdomen, you may be a candidate for either liposuction or a mini tummy tuck depending on the laxity of your skin.

</div><p>Liposuction is used to remove fat from below the skin. There is usually some skin shrinkage or contraction. A tummy tuck revoves both excess skin and fat. The muscles underneath are also tightened to narrow the waistline.</p><p>Liposuction and abdominoplasty can usually be performed safely together. (Michael Orseck, MD, Greenville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Simply put, liposuction removes fat and relies on the skin to tighten afterwards while a tummy tuck removes the fat AND skin and allows for tightening of the muscles. Most women who after pregnancy have problems with skin tone due to the rapid expansion and subsequent stretching of the abdominal skin.</p><p>Multiple pregnancies can worsen this. This rapid change can also leave “stretch marks” or scars in the deep layers of the skin which can be obvious. The changes to the “six-pack” muscles (rectus abdominus muscles) spread apart as a natural consequence of the pregnancy.</p><p>To correct these issues, a standard tummy tuck (known as an “abdominoplasty”) is performed. This technique allows for the tightening of the abdominal muscles and removal of the lower “stretched out” skin. Depending on the location of stretch marks, it may also remove the majority of these as well.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_10971" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The downside is the scar across the lower abdomen. This scar is in the same location as C-section scars, but is typically longer. Liposuction is a good option when the primary problem is too much fat and the skin has good tone.</p><p>When the fat is removed, the normal response of the skin is to contract. This technique does nothing to improve the muscles or stretch marks. However, it is done through very small incisions and can have great results for the right person.</p><p>To see which option is best for you, you should schedule an appointment to see your Plastic Surgeon (David Bogue, MD, Boca Raton Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>As always the question of which operation to choose depends on both the anatomy of the particular problem as well as the goals of the patient. In the case of Liposuction vs. Tummy Tuck if the issue is excessive abdominal surface fat but the abdominal skin is taught Liposuction alone will suffice.</p><p>The Tummy Tuck is generally the only solution for tightening this looseness. In addition, the Tuck will also address any muscle weakness that often follows pregnancy and therefore further help to restore normal abdominal contour.</p><p>Liposuction alone will do nothing for lax abdominal skin and muscle. Having said this, it is also important to realize that the Tummy Tuck is significantly more surgery and results in more scarring then liposuction of the abdomen.</p><p>If you prefer less surgery then Liposuction may be an alternative albeit a less perfect one. But, if your are looking for an In clothing improvement achieved by removing the bulk of your abdominal fat and can live with loose skin and muscle, liposuction is your answer.</p><p>If per chance you are unhappy with the results from the Liposuction it is still possible to then have a Tummy Tuck. (David A. Ross, MD (retired), Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In general, stretching of the skin from pregnancy is unlikely to be successfully repaired without a tummy tuck. Most women need a tummy tuck to get maximum improvement of their abdomen. With a tummy tuck, excess skin and fatty tissue from the abdomen is removed and the muscles of the abdominal wall are tightened to achieve as flat an appearance as possible.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_10966" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-4d00b3ef3635fb1c1c49c8df1a54d6d4">

</div><p>Liposuction is better suited for body contouring, not excess skin. It will take care of the fat, but will not take care of the loose skin or abdominal muscles. Using the two procedures in conjunction with each other can give some really nice, balanced results to a woman’s post-baby body. (Deason Dunagan, MD, Huntsville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>When a Plastic Surgeon evaluates a post pregnancy body, there are 3 anatomic problems that must be diagnosed</p><ol>
<li>Skin laxity and redundancy</li>
<li>Muscle separation otherwise known as Diastasis Rectii- usually will be worse in mothers with a history of multiple pregnancies or multiple birth pregnancies such as twins</li>
<li> Extra fat/ fatty bulges</li>
</ol><p>If the problem is only fat and the skin quality is good- a skillful liposuction can give a beautiful improvement. However if there is too much loose skin and/or muscle issues, these need to be adressed to get the best result.</p><p>A Tummytuck or a Mini Tummytuck can treat these additional problems. (David Shuter, MD, Jupiter Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
