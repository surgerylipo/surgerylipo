Your contour will continue to change and improve over the course of a few months, and you might now achieve your final result until a year after surgery.</p><p>Irregularities after Smart lipo usually flatten out, but occasionally these persistent irregularities are related to excessive removal of superficial fat, leaving a ‘dent’. These can be troublesome, and some part of the body of susceptible to these contour irregularities (lateral thigh, inferior gluteal fold).</p><p>Wait a few months before asking your surgeon for any ‘touch-up’ procedures. In our clinic, we have used a gentle course of Endermologie, which appears to minimize soft tissue edema somewhat, and it feels good. (Scott C.

</div><p>Major swelling after having Smart lipo can last for up to 8 weeks. You will not see your final results until 6 months to one year. I have all my patients wear a compression garment for the first 4-6 weeks as it reduces swelling.</p><p>Bruising is normal following Smart lipo and usually subsides over the first few weeks. Gentle massage can help speed up the recovery process. (Saul Lahijani, MD, Los Angeles Physician)</p><p>The swelling from Smart lipo surgery goes down slowly over time. Most of the initial swelling goes down within the first 3 weeks. Most patients can typically see some improvement at that point, and after that it is a slower process to see the final result.</p><p>This can take between 6 and as much as 18 months, depending on the patient and the particular area(s) treated. The calves and ankles area may take 18 months, especially in patients with lipedema. After 6 weeks, a typical patient’s results could already begin to be seen, but I would encourage you to be patient in terms of your final result.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5412" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>With regard to numbness in the treated area, this is pretty typical for many weeks and even months that there can be a sensory decrease, usually from the swelling that is going on, and people can feel numbness in these certain areas.</p><p>It does typically resolve, but be patient as it can take many months to completely resolve. Lastly, with the lumps or any reported irregularity, I’d have to get a better sense of exactly what it looks and feels like.</p><p>Generally speaking, it could be swelling that might go away with time. It could be massaged down, time alone might resolve it, or it may be a dense area of inflammation possibly a scar that might respond to a low dose of a steroid.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5413" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>In this case, I encourage you to see your surgeon for a thorough re-evaluation. (David Amron, MD, Beverly Hills Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>The process of healing after Smart lipo usually takes anywhere from 3 to 6 months, so the fact that areas are numb, and the swelling has not resolved should not be a great concern for you. With that being said, if you notice significant differences between sides it makes sense to speak with your surgeon and ask them for their opinion regarding your concerns.</p><p>Sometimes there are treatments that can help certain aspects of the healing process resolve more quickly, so showing your surgeon the ‘lumps’ that you are describing would be the right first step.<br>
If things are fine you should be reassured, but if there is something like a fluid collection that needs to be treated then doing it sooner would be best. (Isaac Starker, MD, Morristown Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5414" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Smart lipo results can take up to six months before the final look is achieved. The numbness can take anywhere from 3 months to 2 years to return. I would massage the lump 2-3 times a day and follow up with your surgeon! (Maria M. LoTempio, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Most swelling and bruising will heal in the first 2 weeks, but can persist for up to 6-8 weeks. Patients are usually instructed to wear elastic compression garments after the surgery, the period of time will be advised by the doctor. (Jed H. Horowitz, MD, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>When Smart lipo is done, it injures the body’s tissues, and our bodies respond by exuding fluids from the injured tissues into the space left behind where the fat was suctioned out. </p><p>It takes time for the body to heal the injured tissue layers and to stop oozing fluids, and one must be diligent in wearing the compression garment over the treated areas for many weeks–six may not be enough.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5415" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-ec3ee9ea3da410c5b0549d34aea65783">

</div><p>I tell my patients that full resolution of the injury (and therefore, the irregularities in suctioned sites) takes months (and the skin sensation usually returns also). In addition to needing tight garments for compression, I would advise massage, to be done several times per day; confer with your plastic surgeon for precise details on this activity.</p><p>So, give it more time and do the two things above, and keep following up with your surgeon, and it should improve over by the next couple of months. (James H. Scheu, MD, FACS, Saint Louis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The final result following Smart lipo may take up to 6 months to be seen. This will allow time for swelling to subside and skin to tighten. (Reza Nassab, FRCS (Plast), Manchester Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Smart lipo swelling can persist for some time but if you have concerns you can always ask your surgeon. Some irregularity after Smart lipo is normal and should be massaged, but significant lumpiness may mean that the fat was removed in an uneven fashion.</p><p>I tell my patient that 75% of the swelling after Smart lipo will be gone in 3 weeks. The remaining 25% will take another 3 months. Even after all the swelling is gone is still may be up to six months before you see your final results while your body heals and remodels its distribution of fat. (Adam Hamawy, MD, Princeton Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>What you are seeing right after your procedure, or even a couple days after, will not be your final result. Smart lipo takes at least 6-7 months to fully heal. There can be swelling and contour irregularities that will take time to resolve.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5417" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Post-op ultrasound therapy and lymphatic massage to the area can help speed up this process. If the swelling “moves”, you may have a seroma. You should have this evaluated by your plastic surgeon. (David R. Broadway, MD, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Swelling post Smart lipo can take weeks to months. Compression helps to get the swelling out faster. (Leonard Lu, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I counsel my patients that the final result following Smart lipo is typically only revealed around 3 months post-op. Some of the unevenness may flatten out, though some may potentially be permanent. You can effect the degree of this by massaging the areas in question, with the appropriate approval and recommendation of your surgeon.</p><p>Numbness following Smart lipo is extremely common, and can take several months, up to a year to subside. (Joshua D. Zuckerman, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Swelling after Smart lipo is something everyone will experience to some degree. The bulk of the swelling is gone by 6 weeks but some of it can persist for 6 months. (Tyler Angelos, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It usually takes 4-6 months for all the swelling to go down and skin to retract as well.</p><p>The hardness that you are feeling is simply scar tissue that will soften with time and numbness should also resolve soon. Continue to followup with your surgeon and try to stay patient. (Robert M. Tornambe, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Your final result will not be present for 6-12 months</h4><p>After cosmetic procedures the body takes time to heal. With laser Smart lipo the skin will tighten over 3 or so months as the dermis thickens. It’s also not unusual to have some lumps for a few months. (Sean Wright, MD, FACS, Philadelphia Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Depending on the skill and technique of the surgeon you visited, and which form of Smart lipo they performed (Some methods of lipo are harsher on the body than others), post-op swelling can sometimes last up to a year.</p><p></p>

</div>It is important to have consistent followup with your surgeon and good post-op care to see the best results. (Laila Elkeeb, MD, FAAD, Corona Del Mar Dermatologic Surgeon)
<h3>How long for Smart lipo results to be apparent.</h3><p>Your Smart lipo results could take longer than you expect to see final results. During the procedure many of the fat cells are removed with suction and some results can be seen early on, but then once the swelling occurs (usually largest at 10 – 14 days) it may seem like you feel “larger” than you did before your surgery.</p><p>If the fat cell is damaged during surgery, which many are, it can again actually take up to six months for the body to absorb the damaged cells and the “fat” within them. For lumps after surgery, this is the case as well, but there are some things you can do to help assure these will not remain long term.</p><p>Many practices offer treatments such as post surgery massages with a specialist or other non-surgical modalities to help “smooth out” these lumps. If you are concerned it is always best to seek the advice of your surgeon. (Reps B. Sundin, MD, Washington DC Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
