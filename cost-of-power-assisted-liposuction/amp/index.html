</div><p>The cost of Power Assisted Liposuction varies by surgeon and where you live. I charge by the area for liposuction. Typical area locations include the lateral thighs, abdomen, inner thighs and “love handles”. Ideal candidates for liposuction in Minneapolis-St.Paul, MN, are at their ideal body weight and have good skin tone.</p><p>The average price for one area of liposuction (includes surgeon fee, facility, anesthesia, and follow up checks) is between $3,000-$5,500.00 total. (Heather Rocheford, MD, Minneapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Power Assisted Liposuction prices vary from 3800 to 8000</em></p><p>The cost depends primarily on the areas treated. However, the majority of patients are interested in contouring the same areas or combinations of areasI certainly wouldn’t choose on price, but of course the price must meet your budget.</p><p>The most common areas are the chin, abdomen, abdomen with flanks, and abdomen/flanks/inner and outer thighs.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5555" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>The cost does depend on the size of the patient. For thinner patients, we perform liposculpting with mini cannulas to decrease the chance of skin dimpling so thinner is not always less expensive.</p><p>The abdomen area is prone to dimpling so we use a special basket cannula using the SAFE technique to enhance results. The outer thigh must be contoured 180 degrees including the banana roll area to make the buttock area look perkier and less wide.</p><p><strong>General costs (incl facility/anesthesia)</strong></p><ul>
<li>Abdomen under 4000</li>
<li>Abd w flanks 5-6,000</li>
<li>Chin under 4000</li>
<li>Abd/flanks/thighs 6-8,000. (Pramit Malhotra, MD, Ann Arbor Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ul><p>Power Assisted Liposuction cost varies based upon how many different areas you have treated. For a single area it usually ranges from $3000-5000, each additional area can be from $1000-3000. The main variables are the size of the area and how much fat is anticipated to be removed.

Power Assisted Liposuction under local anesthesia, plug in your ipod or headphones, the problem area is treated and when you get up and can go home without pain. I did not think it was possible, but it is.</p><p>For 4 years in 258 pts, I have used water liposuction to treat all areas of the body: men and women, tummy, love handles, flanks, arms, back, neck, thighs, knees.</p><p>The results are immediate and shape-defining. Now the best part: Until the end of February, this lipo procedure is $3000 all inclusive one area or $5000 for two areas.</p><p>Why? Because it works and it does have a quicker recovery.

</div><h5>How Much Does Power Assisted Liposuction Cost? Do you get discounts for the lipo price if you get lipo on multiple areas?</h5><p>All cosmetic procedures will vary and have a range of costs. There’s always a facility fee, anesthesia, and a surgeon’s fee. Usually with liposuction- there are multiple areas. Only after exam and a thorough consultation can a cost be determined.</p><p>The costs start with 4,000 and up(Thomas Trevisani, Sr., MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Power Assisted Liposuction cost, Fairfield County, Connecticut</strong></p><p><em>Recovery after liposuction:</em></p><ul>

Average Costs are: $5000-$7000 depending on the amount of time needed in the OR and anesthesia. (Alfred Sofer, MD, FACS, Fairfield Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Power Assisted Liposuction Cost San Antonio, TX</i></p><p>Power Assisted Liposuction cost depends on a number of things including but not limited to:</p><ol>
<li>The number of areas being liposuctioned</li>
<li>Area of the country you live in</li>
<li>Expertise of the physician — we recommend a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon</li>
</ol><p>It is hard to give you an estimate without knowing exactly what area you are interested in. During the consultation we can discuss all areas you are interested in and better evaluate you as an individual to see if you are a good candidate for Power Assisted Liposuction. To give you an estimate, Power Assisted Liposuction of Abdomen and Waist costs $4,700 this includes the facility, anesthesia, and physician.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5559" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Each additional area increase the cost by about $1,000-$1,500. (Bernard Kopchinski, MD, FACS, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>How much does liposuction cost?</h5><p>Power Assisted Liposuction can be performed on small, medium, or large areas. It can be performed on both sides of the body or only one side. Sometimes it is done jointly with other procedures.</p><p>Sometimes liposuction can be done using a local anesthetic or requires a general anesthetic.</p><p>Therefore, the price range is large, ranging from $2000 to $10,000 and up. Discuss specific areas with your surgeon. (John Zavell, MD, FACS, Toledo Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Power Assisted Liposuction costs vary according to your body mass index and the location of fat removal. The chin and arms tend to be the least cost, starting around $4000 if there is not too much to be removed.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5560" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-4a0a93f39a9476b03c5b55470ebe86a4">

</div><p>The best is to come in and be seen in person. Grouping procedures can also lower costs. (Justin Yovino, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost for Power Assisted Liposuction will vary based on the amount of area that needs to be treated. Generally flanks, abdomen, thighs, arms, chest will all be treated as separate areas. In general the cost can vary between $3500 up to 10 to $15,000 depending on the extent of surgery needed.</p><p>It is best to have a consultation with a board certified plastic surgeon who can discuss your needs and provide you with an estimated cost. (Christopher Khorsandi, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>That’s a bit like asking how much does it cost to paint a house, but the logic is similar. I’d meet with the painting contractors. They look at my house, discuss the extent of the restoration, materials used, what they will do and then I check their references.</p><p>For a similar job, the prices might vary but ultimately I’ll choose the contractor who I want to do the job based upon their reputation and my impression of the quality of work they might do for me.</p><p>Their price varies depending upon how much of the house I need to have panted, how difficult and time consuming the job might be and the cost of their materials. Thats is how a plastic surgeon might choose who to paint their house.</p><p>When you choose a liposuction surgeon, choose a board certified plastic surgeon who is experienced in Power Assisted Liposuction. Make sure it is someone who understands your needs and desires. The price will vary depending upon how much work needs to be done, the city, the anticipated difficulty of the case and the resources such as operating room time that will be used.</p><p>You can learn more by having more than one consultation. (Barry S. Citron, MD, FACS, Montclair Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Power Assisted Liposuction cost varies more than any other procedure in plastic surgery. The cost will vary on geographic region, type of facility (hospital vs physician office vs med spa), type of anesthesia, type of physician (board certified plastic surgeon vs family practice doctor), and how many areas you would like addressed.</p><p>In Alabama, the cost will vary from around $3,000 to $8,000. Some surgeons charge by site and others by time. I estimate the amount of time the procedure will take and base the cost from that estimate.</p><p>If you want multiple areas addressed and have more fat than someone who would like one area and has minimal fat, your procedure will be more expensive.

</div><p>The cost of Power Assisted Liposuction really depends on how much time is required to treat you. More fat takes longer to remove. More areas take longer. That said, most surgeons will likely offer you some reduced rate per area if multiple are being treated.</p><p>More important than cost is making sure that you are seen by a qualified plastic surgeon for this.</p><p>Although this procedure seems straightforward, safety and good results are not assured in unskilled hands. It is important to be properly assessed to see if you are a good candidate.</p><p>Nothing increases costs as much as having to see a different doctor for revision work. (Rodger Shortt, FRCSC, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Power Assisted Liposuction is popular in Las Vegas and worldwide because it effectively reduces and sculpts areas of isolated fat. It starts at $3500 (cost may vary depending on the area.) (Arthur M. Cambeiro, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Power Assisted Liposuction in the Midwest, US: $2800-$4500</h5><p>The cost for Power Assisted Liposuction will vary depending on the number of areas treated and the geographic location where you have your surgery performed. Often, you will find the cost of cosmetic surgery somewhat higher on the East and West Coast than you would in the Midwest.</p><p>Power Assisted Liposuction of one area will cost less than liposuction of three areas. Three areas would very likely be the abdomen, hips and thighs. In general, the cost for liposuction in the Midwest will be between $2800-4500. (John J. Edney, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
