<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Aqualipo is the fastest growing procedure in USA. The goal of water assisted liposuction is to improve body’s contour by removing presistant fat deposits that just will not go away.</p><p>It has become a very safe out-patient procedure, and can be done under local, sedation or general anesthesia depending on the amount of liposuction performed and patient’s anxiety level.</p><p>Costs vary from region to region but depend on the number of areas treated. Usually starts from $3500 for the first area and each additional area can cost around $1000 to $2500.</p><p>Most surgeon also supply the garment that must be worn after Body Jet liposuction. (Shahriar Mabourakh, MD, FACS, Sacramento Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Aqualipo cost varies by region, surgeon demand, amount of areas treated, what facility it is done in and the amount of time required. It’s unfortunately impossible to give you a price quote without a consultation. (David Shifrin, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5856" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>Aqualipo in my practice typically costs between $5,000 and $12,000. Smaller volume cases performed under local anesthesia are the less expensive procedures. Larger volume fat removal and treatment of multiple areas requires more time, so those procedures are on the higher end of that range. (David Stoker, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Aqualipo Pricing</b></p><p>Pricing for Body Jet liposuction (like most cosmetic surgeries) typically includes 3 different charges: the surgeon’s fee (you’re paying for their expertise, time, and labor), anesthesiologist fee (you are closely monitored by a professional anesthesiologist while under general anesthesia), and facility fee (the operating room, the tools, the staff, the nurses, etc.)</p><p>Our professional fees for Body Jet liposuction are $1,500 per area (however, we consider the entire abdomen as technically two areas, upper & lower). The national average for surgeon’s fees are around $2,200 for one area (i.e. full abdomen), $4,600 for two areas (i.e. full abdomen & both inner thighs), and $7,000 for five areas. Anesthesia fees usually range between $300 – $600 per hour, so the total price would depend on how long your surgery takes (varies from patient to patient).</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5857" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>Lastly, facility fees are also usually calculated per hour so it would vary based on the patient (can range anywhere from about $800 – $1,500 per hour). It is standard in most practices to receive a discount when you are considering more than 1 area of liposuction. (Edward P. Miranda, MD, FACS, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Aqualipo cost depends on the intensity of the procedure</h5><p>The cost of the lipo depends on the intensity of the procedure and the number of areas that need to be treated with . If you are thinking to have multiple areas then you would be reducing the cost on the anesthesia,operation theater cost ,surgeon and nursing charges.

</div><p>The basic fee for one area is $6200 and each additional area is calculated based on the amount of time necessary to address. There is a limit as to the volume of fat that can be safely removed in one setting. (Leila Kasrai, MD, FRCSC, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You will find a great variation in the cost of Water Jet Liposuction for many reasons.</p><p>Aqualipo is done in many different ways and by several different types of physiciancs, and in different types of conditions.</p><p>Dermatologists tend to perform liposuction using local anesthesia, while plastic surgeons tend to more often utilize general anesthesia.</p><p>There are several different types of water assisted liposuction machines, and the costs of these machines are often reflected in liposuction prices. In my practice I sometimes use local anesthesia but often do more extensive liposuction that is more comfortable for the patient when performed under general anesthesia in the Montecito Surgery Center.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5859" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d87d550619663a1157fa2e6f7e0b1eb5">

</div><p>For liposuction of up to 2 areas of the body, we charge $7000 including the surgical fees, the anesthesia, the operating room/surgery center and all pre- and post-operative visits.</p><p>You will find that like pricing, results are also quite variable when it comes to liposuction. My strong recommendation is to find a surgeon with whom you are comfortable, who can explain how and why he is going to perform particular techniques, and who’s results you find appropriate and aesthetic. (Adam David Lowenstein, MD, FACS, Santa Barbara Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Aqualipo Cost in Miami</i></p><p>Pricing varies from regional areas. Some are costlier than others. In Miami prices are petty competitive and how it is determined is by how many areas need to be suctioned and whether the patient is going to do something with the fat that has been removed.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5860" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Such as a fat transfer (brazilian butt lift). In Miami, Water Jet Liposuction prices average from $2000 to $5800. Prices increase depending on how many areas you would like to target. (Mel T. Ortega, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Aqualipo Fees</i></p><p>Aqualipo fees are typically determined by the size of the area, number of areas to be treated and the estimated procedure time. We charge per area (abdomen, flanks, back, inner or outer thigh etc.) as due most plastic surgeons.</p><p>Fees can range between $3000-$6000 or more depending on your area of residence. You would need to be seen for a consultation in order to better address your needs and be given a custom fee estimate. (Morgan E. Norris, III, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of liposuction usually depends on which area is being treated and how many areas. This will translate into the amount of work and time involved. There are usually 3 types of fees involved, the surgeon’s professional fee for performing the surgery and follow-up care, the anesthesia fee, and the surgical facility fee.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5861" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-9502fd6ef4df8cccaa4b7163e9049062">

</div><p>Aqualipo is usually performed either in a doctor’s office or an outpatient surgery center, where the associated fees are charged by other entities. If performed in the office, then the surgeon may be able to quote a lower total fee because he/she can charge less for the anesthesia and surgical supplies.</p><p>Surgeons usually have a set fee per area depending on the average amount of work involved, but this can vary. For example, an average fee for liposuction of the abdomen and flanks might cost between $1,800 and $3,5000 depending on the type of anesthesia chosen and the time/work involved, as well as where the surgery was done (in office or at surgery center). (Richard G. Schwartz, MD, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Depending on the physician, size of the area, anesthesia and the area where you live, equipment cost etc. (Jhonny Salomon, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I typically see liposuction costs begin at 4500 for the first area and go up by 1500-2500 per additional area. The cost is determined by the amount of time your procedure takes.</p><p>Therefore a more extensive liposuction of the same area may take longer and be more costly. (Paul S. Gill, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The prices for water assisted liposuction vary based on: the number of areas treated, if the liposuction is an isolated procedure or a part of another surgery, and whether it is performed under local or general anesthesia.</p><p>The base prices may vary from $3500 to $4500. (Alexander Golger, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>liposuction costs can vary widely depending upon the type of liposuction performed, the number of sites undergoing liposuction, and the need for general anesthesia. When choosing a liposuction surgeon, it is VERY important not to use price as your only parameter.</p><p>Be sure you are seeing a surgeon board certified in Plastic Surgery that has a practice primarily involved with cosmetic surgery. Please be sure your surgeon is listed on the American Board of Plastic Surgery website. (Robert Steely, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In Dominican Republic we dont charge the liposuction per area, we do a complete liposculpture including all the areas were you need water assisted liposuction. The cost varies from 2500 to 4000 dollars dependig on doctors, clinic and patient size. (Manuel Diaz, MD, Dominican Republic Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Aqualipo cost varies</h5><p>Aqualipo prices will vary from city to city and surgeon to surgeon. There are many variable in price. Often these variables are not in the control of the surgeon, (O. R. fee, anesthesia fee, supplies, etc).</p><p>Beware of bargain basement pricing. Cheap can become expensive quickly. Best to see a board certified plastic surgeon. Together you should be able to find a plan that is safe and effective. (Jeffrey J. Roth, MD, FACS, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
