In this case, liposuction is not a method of treating obesity, since it does not affect the pathogenesis of this disease and does not allow the removal of significant amounts of fat.</p><p>However, the visual effect of liposuction for the figure may be more significant than when losing the same fat mass in other ways. It should be noted that due to loss of skin elasticity with age, the results of liposuction in elderly people will not be the same as in younger patients with elastic skin. When removing fat from the “fat trap” there is an excess of skin covering it, the subsequent reduction of which provides a good result of treatment.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_11785" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>Currently, for optimal results, most surgeons use a combination of these methods, performing both ultrasound and tuft liposuction during surgery: ultrasonic liposuction is used to remove denser fat tissue, tumescent liposuction is more often used to remove loose adipose tissue. The operation is performed under local anesthesia in combination with intravenous anesthesia.</p><p>The essence of the operation is that a special solution consisting of a liquid containing electrolytes, a local anesthetic and vasoconstrictive preparations is introduced into the chosen area of fatty deposits. Then small punctures or small incisions, 3-5 mm long, are made.</p><p>With the help of a cannula (thin metal tubes 2-4 mm in diameter and 10 to 30 cm long) inserted under the skin and attached to the vacuum suction, fat suction is carried out.

</div><p>It should be noted that with age, the skin becomes less elastic, and when removing fat deposits, a situation may arise where the skin remains slightly flabby. To avoid this, you should carefully look after her and play sports that will help to tighten the problem areas. But before you carry out this type of leg correction, you should know all the recommendations of a specialist doctor.</p><h3>Types and methods of upper leg liposuction</h3><p>Today, girls have the opportunity to choose both an operating and non-surgical way of liposuction. An experienced specialist will tell you which method is best for you, depending on the health status and the nature of the formation of excess deposits.</p><h3>There are such types of liposuction:</h3><ul>
<li>Vacuum</li>
<li>Laser</li>
<li>Ultrasound</li>
<li>Tumescent</li>
<li>Radio frequency</li>
<li>Water jet</li>

</div><p>Vacuum upper leg liposuction is a radical way to eliminate excess fat. To do this, a saline solution is introduced into the fatty interlayers, which contains adrenaline. It dilutes fat. After that, small incisions on the surface of the legs are inserted into the cannula, through which fat is sucked. This method is great for those who want to remove a large amount of adipose tissue.</p><p>The method of contrasts differs from the standard procedure in that a liquid consisting of saline, anesthetics and vasoconstrictive drugs is introduced into the problem area.</p><p>Another effective method is to bombard your legs with ultrasound, which practically turns fat into an emulsion.</p><p>Then it is sucked from the body with a vacuum. Radiofrequency and ultrasound correction of the legs can also be performed without stretching the fat. After destruction by ultrasound and radio waves, it is simply excreted naturally through the intestine and kidneys.</p><p>The laser procedure is considered painless and does not leave a trace behind itself. After all, the whole procedure is carried out through a small puncture of the skin. Laser treatment of the skin, in addition, has the advantage that the skin itself is tightened. One of the advanced procedures is cold liposuction of the legs.</p><p>This method is based on the property of fat to break down under the influence of low temperatures. This operation lasts no more than an hour. Areas of the body are covered with special gaskets and are treated with low temperatures.</p><p>This kind of procedure is completely painless and carries no burden on the liver or kidneys. At the same time, the fat leaves the body on its own for three months.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_11793" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h3>Recovery in the postoperative period</h3><p>All types of correction are simple, and on the second day the patient is discharged from the hospital.</p><p>But it is very important in the first period after the procedure not to give a strong load on the legs. Also recommend some time to wear special elastic underwear, which will support the soft tissues to their full recovery and reduction.</p><p>In the first three weeks, some painful sensations are possible, but this problem is solved with the help of analgesics.</p><p>The result and effect of the operation can be seen on the third or fourth month, when all the unpleasant symptoms disappear, and the correction of the legs will have a full and complete result.

</div><p>Numerous reviews on the procedure for removing fat deposits with liposuction are mostly positive. In the effectiveness of the result you can see for yourself by looking at the photos before and after the procedure. Thanks to modern technologies, it is not only very effective and efficient, but also painless.</p><p>At the same time, the result remains for a long time, and there are no health problems. In addition, the rehabilitation period is small, which allows many women not to interrupt their work and not to violate their plans.</p><h3>Who said that getting rid of cellulite is difficult?</h3><ul>
<li>The type of tubercles and depressions on the skin do not add self-confidence …</li>
<li>And now it’s embarrassing to wear open clothes, in which you were irresistible a few years ago …</li>
<li>And massages, fitness and diets did not help much …</li>
<li>In addition, you have already begun to get used to the orange peel and almost convinced yourself that this is the norm …</li>
<li>But you are still ready to take advantage of the chance to get rid of cellulite!</li>
