<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>There are several variables which affect liposuction cost. I believe that they can be broken down to five general categories, the 4 T’s and the number of areas one is have liposuction on being the 5th.</p><h3>The 4 T’s include:</h3><p>(1) <strong>Technique</strong> — There are five levels of liposuction: Deep fat removal, deep and superficial fat removal, deep and superficial fat removal with skin tightening technique (superficial liposuction), high-definition liposculpture (VASER Hi Def) and high definition liposculpture with fat grafting.</p><p>Each of these levels of liposuction is progressively more aggressive and costs more as well. Not all patients need or want the higher levels though.</p><p>(2) <strong>Technology</strong> — Such as VASER and Smartlipo give the surgeon ability to do more aggressive liposuction is some cases and can raise the cost.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2641" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>(3) <strong>Training</strong> — Some surgeons are trained in high-definition and artistic liposculpture which can also be a cost factor.</p><p>(4) <strong>Technician</strong> — Being the “surgeon” him or herself can vary in price depending on there experience. Most patients can expect discounting of additional areas beyond the first area, though thsi may vary from surgeon to surgeon. (John Millard, MD, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The fees for liposuction vary greatly depending on area of the country, areas of the body to be treated, and how many areas are to be treated at once. I typically discount additional areas beyond the first one.

b) location<br>
c) complexity (pre-existing scar tissue etc)</p><h4>3) geographical location</h4><p>On average you should expect about $7000-8000 per region. If money is an issue, one can consider major academic centers where experienced surgeons supervise fellows and offer patients significant discount.</p><p>CareCredit is another good alternative for a payment plan. (Hooman Khorasani, MD, New York Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of liposuction as well as all surgical procedures varies between surgeons and locations and there is typically a reduction in cost if there are multiple areas and multiple procedures. (Payman Danielpour, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2643" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Cost will certainly vary from having one large part (abdomen or thighs) vs. a smaller part (chin/neck) treated vs. multiple areas (back, abdomen, thighs, etc…). Multiple areas are likely going to result in discounts by many surgeons. (Evan Sorokin, MD, Cherry Hill Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Liposuction costs in Florida </strong></p><p>The cost of your liposuction procedure will determined by the volume of fat to be removed, the location and size of the affected area. Most reputable surgeons will need to examine you in person in order to provide an exact cost.</p><p>Different areas will require different techniques in order to achieve an optimum result. Vaser Lipo sculpture is often essential for male body and breast contouring. For excessively redundant and saggy areas additional skin removal and tightening procedures may be required.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2644" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The expertise and experience of your surgeon should be your most important criteria. (Marvin F. Shienbaum, MD, Brandon Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost all depends on how many areas and how large the areas to be done are. The cost decrease with each area since we are already there. Cost for me vary from 1000 up to 6000-7000 all depending on how many and size areas. (Scott W. Vann, MD, FACS, Savannah Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>How much does Liposuction cost in Columbus, Ohio?</em></p><p>Liposuction fees will vary based on a number of factors including the areas of concern, the type of anesthetic and even your geographical location. At The Sullivan Centre in Columbus, Ohio the first area of liposuction is $2000, the second area is $1500 and additional areas are $100 per area.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2645" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>This does not include facility or anesthesia fees! (Christine Sullivan, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>How much does liposuction cost</b></p><p>To be honest, it’s impossible to quote liposuction without seeing you because there are too many variables involved.</p><p>There are several reasons for this:</p><p>1. Your board certified plastic surgeon can’t assess the quality of your skin over the phone. If you have a great amount of loose skin and stretch marks on your abdomen, for example, a qualified and experienced surgeon may recommend a tummy tuck rather than liposuction. Age plays a role as does the amount of stretch marks.</p><p>2. Your board certified plastic surgeon can’t evaluate the amount of lipo necessary to achieve your goals without seeing you. Lipo on a 105 lb woman’s thighs may take much less time than lipo on a 190 lb woman’s thighs.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2646" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-059830fc09ccdf39fcb7a0d700faa343">

</div><p>3. You can’t see your prospective surgeon’s office, meet the staff, or view before/afters unless you go into the office. Sure, we all have before/after photos on our websites, but most of us don’t have the hundreds of before/after sets that show the breadth and depth of our experience.</p><p>These extra photos are available in the office. Plastic surgery of any kind deserves an in-person consultation with a qualified, experienced and skilled board certified plastic surgeon. Costs can vary by area of the country, whether it’s performed in the hospital or a surgery center, the level of skill of the anesthesiologist (RN vs MD) and other factors.</p><p>I always caution patients to remember they aren’t buying a retail product, where the same Tide Detergent may vary by price from one store to another.</p><p>They are buying skill, experience and, ultimately, lifelong results. For that you want the best you can find. Over your lifetime the difference in price will be negligible between one physician and another, but the difference in results might not be. (Paul Vanek, MD, Cleveland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Liposuction cost varies as follows:</em></p><p>As with everything, liposuction cost is variable based on multiple factors but the following are the most pertinent:</p><ol>
<li>Individual surgeon</li>
<li>Number of areas</li>
<li>Local anesthesia vs General anesthesia</li>
<li>Location of the country</li>
</ol><p>Liposuction of a small area such as the lower abdomen under local anesthesia may be as little as 2-3 thousand dollars.</p><p>Whereas liposuction of multiple areas requiring general anesthesia and position changes in the operating room may be 10-15K. Of course, the more areas you do the less expensive each additional area becomes since the resources to perform the liposuction are all there.</p><p>I recommend that you consult with 2-3 board certified plastic surgeons and try to compare apples to apples. Do not worry about the type of liposuction used as much as the experience, before and after results, and reviews of the surgeon you are considering–that is the most important. (Remus Repta, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Use cost as the last deciding factor in choosing your surgeon. The very expensive plastic surgeons are not necessarily the best. This is the order in which I recommend you ought to make your choice:</p><ol>
<li>Board Certified Plastic Surgeon</li>
<li>At least 5 years of independent experience in this procedure with consistently good results and very low revision rate. You should ask for this information right out. The right surgeon would not be offended by you asking for this information.</li>
<li>Affiliated with a reputable hospital.</li>
<li>Ask others, especially operating room nurses if you know any, for recommendations. Patient who have undergone this procedure previously are also an excellent source of information and recommendation.</li>
<li>
<strong>Price</strong>. One who has a fixed price and does not reduce his/her fee if you have more areas treated. in deciding the number of areas to be treated be guided foremost by safety. More, if it passes the safety criteria should not cost less. If somebody charges less the more work he has to do then he is trying to sell you something and surgery is not a commodity that you try to sell.</li>
</ol><p>I charge $2000 for each area, paired areas (i.e. right and left) are counted as one area, 50% of this fee for each subsequent area. Usually the anesthesia fee is $750 to $1500 depending on the number of areas to be treated (I use Board Certified Anaesthesiologists or CRNAs if I am familiar with their safety record.</p><p>Most CRNAs are very good and very safe and kind) The facility fee is usually $1500 to $2000 for one area or more. For small areas I charge a fee of $2500 inclusive of all other charges and I do not use general anesthesia for these cases.</p><p>In selected patients who want to reduce the total cost and are suitable for having the procedure done under local anesthesia with PO sedation I do one area per session and the sessions are at least 3 days apart.</p><p>I work out a total fee as above for the number of areas; there is no charge for anesthesia and the facility fee is a very reduced fee for each session but all fees for the anticipated sessions are paid in advance. (Gurmander Singh Kohli, MD, FACS, Fall River Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Liposuction Cost is now affordable</h3><p>Cost of liposuction depends on three factors. Body Areas to be treated Amount of Fat to be removed technology. in india total all inclusive cost for liposuction varies from USD 1000 to 2500 for multiple areas and with most advanced Laser + ultra sound assisted liposuction technology.</p><p>If you are looking for Full body liposuction, you required two sessions of liposuction. total expenses for two session will be Approx. USD 5000 in Mumbai, India. (Milan Doshi, MS, MCh, India Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
