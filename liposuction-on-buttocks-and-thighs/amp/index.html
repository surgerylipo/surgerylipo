<li>Oncological diseases</li>
<li>Violation of blood clotting</li>

And all that was previously listed, is a kind of information consent to the implementation of this operation.</p><h4>The general principle of performing a liposuction operation in the hip area</h4><p>Typically, this procedure is often carried out under local anesthesia, but general anesthesia is also possible, but this requires your desire and the surgeon’s recommendation.

In their case, a radical surgical operation combined with liposuction will be very effective.

</div><p>But be careful – this procedure is not so safe, especially if it is not conducted by a top-level professional.</p><h3>Liposuction in the hips and buttocks</h3><p>Uneven fat deposition on the outer and inner sides of the thighs is a serious flaw in the female figure. No matter how many people talk about the seductiveness of the magnificent forms, every woman in her soul dreams of slender legs, a thin waist and beautiful proportions. Especially offensive to those ladies whose weight does not significantly exceed the norm, but at the same time the thighs and buttocks differ in excessive completeness.</p><p>Laser liposuction of the thighs and buttocks is one of the effective ways to overcome the natural (and acquired) flaws of the figure with the help of body plastics. In the presence of pronounced disproportions, playing sports and dieting do not give the desired result, despite the relative success in the area of body contour correction. To remove excess fat without surgeries, exhausting exercises and massages is a very real task that every person can cope with.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_11731" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h3>How is laser liposuction performed on thighs and buttocks?</h3><p>Liposuction of the thighs and buttocks is carried out after a preliminary consultation with a plastic surgeon. Medical manipulations are performed using a Smartlipo device that generates a powerful flash of radiation in a millionth of a second. A directional beam destroys the membranes of fat cells, converting dense fat into a mobile emulsified mass that enters the lymphatic system and then undergoes a biological transformation in the liver.</p><p>The beam that destroys the fat is guided through a miniature cannula (diameter 1mm optical fiber – 300 microns), targeting only fat tissue. The system is controlled by electronic devices, which ensures the highest accuracy of liposuction.</p><h3>Effect and recommendations</h3><p>After liposuction of the inner surface of the thighs, the skin is pulled up, becomes more elastic. This effect is explained by the fact that the laser has the ability to stimulate the synthesis of cells that produce HA. Already 7-14 days after the procedure, a pronounced cosmetic effect is visible – disappear, so-called “ears”, saggy gluteal folds.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_11732" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>With the recommendations of the doctor, the aesthetics of proportions persist for a long period of time. One session lasts 40-60 minutes. General anesthesia is not applied, since laser radiation does not cause pain. The maximum that the patient (patient) can experience during liposuction of the thighs is an easy burning in the area of the laser probe.</p><h3>The advantages of laser liposuction thighs and buttocks</h3><ul>
<li>minimal traumatic effect on tissues;</li>
<li>absence of scars and scars;</li>
<li>high aesthetic result;</li>
<li>absence of subcutaneous hemorrhages;</li>
<li>pronounced rejuvenating effect;</li>

<li>With congenital or acquired autoimmune diseases.</li>
</ol><p>The decision on the possibility of carrying out the procedure is taken by the clinic doctor, taking into account a combination of medical factors. If we compare laser liposuction with other methods of fat removal, then we can safely say that the laser, to date, is the most progressive and safe method used in aesthetic medicine.</p><p>The specialists of the clinic have professional experience in the field of application of laser technology of the last generation. For liposuction of the hips and buttocks, the price depends on the treatment technique used (determined by the scope of the surgeon’s work), the time of the procedure. The procedure of liposuction helps to improve the contours of the body. Often in women, fat is deposited on the hips and in the buttocks. Even the most slender girls can suffer because of a similar problem.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_11734" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">
