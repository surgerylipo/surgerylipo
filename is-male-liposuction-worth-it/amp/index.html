Abdominal area, “love handles”, breast area, flanks, neck, and jawline area, are commonly treated with liposuction in male patients.</p><p>Liposuction is highly safe technique when done by a board certified plastic, reconstructive and aesthetic surgeon.</p><p>The use of a compression garment is a role during 1 month after liposuction. As men skin is thicker usually, the shrink down is often better than the same liposuction procedure in women.</p><p>Yes, liposuction can definitely help men the same as it can help women, and the risks are the same as for women. However, note that the techniques may be a little different because men’s fat is generally more fibrous.</p><p>The risks with liposuction are the same for men as for women.

</div><p>Liposuction procedure, as well as other cosmetic procedures, are gaining rapid popularity amongst men. I often have male patients wanting body sculpting and contouring treatments – the most addressed areas are the abdomen (more men want a defined abdomen), flanks and chest.</p><p>More and more men are seeking cosmetic procedures such as liposuction andabdominoplasties. They are doing these procedures for health reasons and for promotion reasons at work. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Male Liposuction is Growing in Popularity and Very Common</em></p><p>For years cosmetic or plastic surgery was largely associated with women, however, in recent years I have found that male patients are actually making up more and more of my patient population. When compared to other surgical procedures I perform, liposuction is becoming one of the most popular plastic surgery operations performed in men and has yielded fantastic results.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4758" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>For men who are close to their goal weight and complain of localized and stubborn fat ‘problem’ areas that are resistant to diet and even vigorous exercise regimens, liposuction is often a great surgical option.</p><p>Common treatment areas for men include the chest, abdomen and love handles, and in my practice this procedure has tremendously improved the way that these male patients look and feel.</p><p>Generally speaking, liposuction is best used to improve upon ones own body contours, and is a relatively low-risk surgical procedure. (Stephen T. Greenberg, MD, Woodbury Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>About half of the patients seeking work on their love handles are male. I agree completely that the media has hyped this procedure as more oriented to female patients but there is a definitely a demand for it from men.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4759" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>My male patients don’t gab about it to their pals in the same way that women share their stories and results but have a high satisfaction rate. I find them to be highly motivated and seeking surgery after exercise has failed to address their issues.</p><p>Cosmetic surgery is definitely not for women only! (Robert L. Kraft, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Although men tend to talk about liposuction less than women, nearly half of my liposuction patients are men. The most common areas for liposuction for men are the “love handles” on the side of the abdomen and the central abdomen.</p><p>Frequently liposuction techniques can be used for male breast reduction surgery as well in the neck under the chin. The results can be dramatic and offer very high patient satisfaction under the correct circumstances. (John K.

</div><p>Men do very well with liposuction of love handles. More and more men are seeking out cosmetic surgery every day. It is important to look and feel our best whether we are male or female.</p><p>The potential complications for this surgery are similar for men and women. (Sanjiv Kayastha, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Men Benefiting from Liposuction</h4><p>Men do GREAT with LOVE HANDEL LIPOSUCTION. The risks fro men are extremely low and the same holds for women. Liposuction is extremely safe in safe hands of ABPS surgeons and can be dangerous in some hands.</p><p>Men have liposuction primarily for neck, jaw line, jowl, man boobs, and love handles. (George Commons, MD, Palo Alto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Experience matters. I frequently do liposuction on men in the very areas that you would like improved. Liposuction to the love handles and stomach roll is overall safe. There are similar risks and complications for either sex, but in the hands of an experienced plastic surgeon these are minimal. (George John Alexander, MD, FACS, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4761" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-326e6279312e456c66f14329a9eb3680">

</div><p><strong>Men do very well with liposuction</strong></p><p>We often see men interested in treating their necks and chins, and the love handles. Male breasts are also a popular area of concern. Sometimes the male stomach area is less amenable to liposuction, as the muscle may be in the way of the fat in question.</p><p>Overall, men heal well and do well just like women. Generally men may be less verbal about their procedures, although that appears to be changing. There seems to be less reluctance among the younger men in discussing excess male breast tissue. (Christopher J. Peers, MD, South Bend Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Male liposuction is very common in my practice</strong></p><p>Men have liposuction and can get great results from the procedure. Typically, men are concerned with the lovehandles, flanks, abdomen and chest area (gynocomastia, for example). Risk factors are similar to those of women. (Peter Schmid, DO, FAACS, Longmont Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In my practice, the most commonly requested surgery in men is liposuction of the “love handles” and abdomen. Because liposuction is best to treat localized areas of fat deposition, also referred to as “body contouring”, this is one of the best and most common areas performed.</p><p>The results are usually superb. The risks for liposuction are the same in men and women. Make sure when choosing a surgeon to do your liposuction, you choose a board certified plastic surgeon. These are the only surgeons who are certified and properly trained in perfoming plastic surgery for the entire body.</p><p>This will significant minimize your risks. (Kenneth Bermudez, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I have many male liposuction patients and they obtain excellent results with trunk liposuction. The risks are actually lower in men. Female hormones can increase risks of blood clots. Men do not have this risk. (Patti A. Flint, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Men can have Liposuction too</strong></p><p>Men can get improvement from liposuction as well. It’s just that many men put fat on inside the abdomen: the “beer belly.” Fat in this area is not amenable to liposuction or tummy tuck surgery.</p><p>But if it’s outside (if you can grab it) then we can treat it. (Mario Loomis, MD, Middletown Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Liposuction for men</strong></p><p>It is very common for men to have liposuction done. Most of the time the area’s needing liposuction are the lower abdomen and love handles. The risks are the same as for women. Men aren’t as open to speak about having liposuction done as woman are. (Jaime Perez, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Men do well with liposuction too (say goodbye to love handles)</b></p><p>Men DO get liposuction, quite often. They just don’t get together with their buddies to talk about it. The most common areas to treat are the love handles, the abdomen and spare tire area, the chest (man-boobs), and the neck, but any area with extra fat can usually be treated.</p><p>Men tend to do really well, as their skin elasticity is usually pretty good. (Carmen Kavali, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Men frequently get liposuction for love handles and stomach roll. Men generally have the same high level of satisfaction and similar risk factors. To ensure happiness, patient selection and a proper consultation process is necessary. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Men get liposuction too. They just don’t talk about it</em></p><p>Plenty of men get liposuction with excellent, satisfying results. They simply don’t go around talking about it as much. The most common areas men want to address are the “love handles” and abdomen, including “lipo-etching” to outline (or give the illusion of) an underlying six-pack.</p><p>The lower abdomen and flank tends to be where men gain weight as they get older, and is hard to get rid of even with working out. Also, there are compression garments to be worn after surgery that are designed specifically for men.</p><p>While men and women have different patterns of weight gain, the risks of liposuction are similar. Male or female, your underlying medical problems and quality of skin are factors that influence whether or not you are a good candidate for surgery. (Anita Patel, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>We currently do many male liposuction cases. The areas of greatest concern to men are somewhat different than women, with men focused on the love handle, abdomen, and chest areas. Excellent results can be achieved in well-selected cases. (Jeffrey D. Wagner, MD, Indianapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The number of men coming to my Las Vegas practice increases each year, not just for liposuction but for other aesthetic procedures such as anti-aging treatments. Statistics show that more men get liposuction every year than any other cosmetic surgical procedure.</p><p>Both liposuction and nonsurgical body contouring, such as CoolSculpting, are ideal for sculpting fat away from the abdomen and waist. Complications following liposuction are rare, and the risks are the same for men and women.(Arthur M. Cambeiro, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>yes, liposuction is for men too! It’s a great tool for sculpting the abdomen, love handles, and waistline. In the right hands, we can even perform “abdominal etching” to give beautiful, masculine definition to the trunk. (Joshua D. Zuckerman, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>At my Austin, Texas area plastic surgery practice I do just as much liposuction on men as I do on women. Abdomen and flanks are the most common areas. Risks are the same and most men can achieve very nice improvement to their body contour. (Mahlon Kerr, MD, FACS, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The risks of Liposuction are associated with the procedure itself, so yes they are the same as for women. (Alberto Di Giuseppe, MBBS, London Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction is an excellent treatment for diet and exercise resistant adipose tissue of the abdomen and flanks ( love handles) for both men and women. Care must be taken with the male patient especially to differentiate visceral (intra-abdominal) adipose tissue from adipose tissue in the subcutaneous plane. (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Risks for Men Having Liposuction</h3><p>Men will commonly undergo liposuction of the abdomen and love handles. Risks are no different for men than they are for women. (Leo Keegan, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Male love handles usually respond very well to liposuction</b></p><p>Men do get liposuctions for the lovehandles. Men have a tendency not to discuss this as much as women. I have performed liposuction on men’s lovehandles many times and they all have been pleased with the results.</p><p>After the procedure, I usually instruct my patients to wear the compression garment for as long as they can or up to 4 weeks, which either comes first. Men usually are not use to wearing the garment and often will stop wearing them after a few weeks.</p><p>At the end, it does not diminish the results. (Andrew Y. Kleinman, MD, Westchester Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Men do get liposuction and it is mainly for the flanks(love handles) and back area. The same indications, risks and alternatives apply as for ladies. Men tends to have more firmer fat pockets which make liposuction a little harder from the surgeon stand point.</p><p>On the other hand they also have a thicker dermis which gives them a better potential. (Hisham Seify, MD, PhD, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction is more common in men than you think. The lower abdomen and love handles are the most common areas that men have liposuction in my practice. The procedure is performed as an outpatient (no overnight stay) and, generally, you can have the procedure on a Thursday or Friday and return to work on Monday.</p><p>You will have several weeks of mild swelling, but you will be able to get back to your normal activities very quickly. (David Shafer, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
