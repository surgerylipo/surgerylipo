<li>I had liposelection done on my hips, flanks, waist and bra bulge. I am 179 cm and have always had a problem with my back fat starting from bra bulge to my hips, other than that my tummy is in good shape even after two pregnancies and so are my arms and legs. I got to the clinic around 10 am, the nurse took me to locker room to change into surgery clothes and then to my room which also served as recovery room. my friends stayed with me till my doctor came then, he took pictures of the areas to be worked on then marked them. Then the anaesthesia doctor came and took me to the operating room. The procedure was very smooth, I was given sedation and local anesthesia. After three hours surgery I woke up dizzy feeling no pain and was taken to the recovery room.The only negative side effect was nausea from the sedation very similar to morning sickness during pregnancy. After about one hour the surgeon came to see me and then nurses helped me put on the compression garments, one fron mid thigh to upper waist and one like a vest that went down to lower waist, after i wore them i saw some immediate results in spite of the swelling. I dozed for an hour then surgeon came to see me again gave me instructions and checked again on my incisions. I left half an hour later still nausous but under control, back home i took panadol pm and slept for a few hours then woke up no more nausea but the incisions were leaking big time!! which is good because its mostly fat. Now 24 hours after surgery, the anaesthesia wore off and i m starting to take subscribed painkillers and feeling great!! Good luck i hope this helps you who are considering liposelection my advise is to chose a really good and well known doctor who doesnt cram three or four surgeries in one day and does not take out more than 4 or 5 litres of fat in other words who care more about doing it safely rather than doing it just for the money.</li>
<li>I just had Liposelection done and it was not bad at all. I had it done on underarm bra bulge and right under that on my back. It hurt a tiny bit when they gave me the shot to numb me. When they put in the saline solution some parts hurt a bit at the beginning, but nothing major. The biggest thing is being awake during this. It’s weird… It feels almost like someone is carving you? It doesn’t hurt but it’s really odd. But you get used to it. Then when they do the fat melting part, sometimes its feels warm on some parts of your body. You also hear this electric noise in your head which it sounds that a radio is trying to get a signal. It was funny/weird… Then they suck out the fat. That was cool to see it coming out. Then after that my Doc had me sit up to see what still needed to be done. Then he did some more sucking and that was it. He left and the nurse helped squeeze additional fluid out of the 4 holes I now had. Then she put dressings on them and then helped me put on my garment. Then when I got up I felt very dizzy from the meds they gave me to calm me down and pain killers. They offered me some anti nausea meds, but I can’t stand the way they make me feel so I declined. I went home and threw up just a little then feel asleep for 2 1/2 hours. Then woke up and I was leaking a lot from my dressings so I had to change those. At this point I was not really sore. Just a tiny bit. I ate dinner and threw up a bit more. Then I ate some more and was fine. Then I went back to sleep. The next day I was up doing normal things which included shopping and going out to lunch until about 3pm. Then I felt tired but still continued to do chores. I went to bed around 7:30pm. That night I was VERY sore to the point where I kept waking up and couldn’t get comfortable. I have only taken Tylenol at this point, besides what they gave me right before the procedure. I didn’t take any of the hard core pain meds because I wanted to “get back to normal” ASAP since I have to go back to work in a couple of days. But I kept hydrated and kept moving which helped a lot….</li>

<li>I had Vaser done on my tummy area and then the inner thighs, arms and saddlebags. The procedure was not bad — just kinda freaky being awake. My doctor was great and during the procedure, allowed me to take more happy pills to keep my anxiety down. I kept my eyes closed, they provided me an Ipod and was not in discomfort. Afterwards, I was sore, but the painkillers helped. It wasn’t as painless as I was led to believe, but it was tolerable. I would have no problem doing it again as I will have to do (I was as big a horse in the tummy area.) I am a total “wimp” when it comes to pain but if you take the painkillers, it’s doable. While I love my new look, I felt like my after-care instructions were lacking. Besides wearing the compression garment, what should I be doing? Could someone tell me about: * Massage? * Water recommendations? * Bruise care? (Hot / Cold Compresses? * When to start exercising? * What type of exercise? * What at those hard spots? Massage them? * When can I take a bath? (I miss the jacuzzi tub and bubble baths) I basically want to know about are the “best practices” for aftercare. I was loopy after the procedure and didn’t retain that information.</li>

<li>I had Vaser Lipo done on my upper abdomen. The procedure itself was a little painful at times, I suppose from when a nerve was hit. My belly blew up to the look as if I were 7 months pregnant, although no bruising. The soreness was a bit rough, and I am very pain tolerant.. My ribs felt bruised for a few days and it just felt as if I were beaten up from the inside out 🙂 It has now been 3 weeks, and I am still swollen, and although my stomach muscles no longer hurt the area is still very “sensitive” and sometimes a bit painful to the touch. I went to the Dr. a week after, and he tried to draw fluid, there was none, so he advised it was all swelling. I wear my compression garment 22-23 hours out of the day, massage my belly with arnica oil, and take Tylenol to ease the pain on occasion. I am trying to be patient for the results. I had a mini-face lift done 2 years ago, and it took a good 6 weeks to see any of the swelling go down then.</li>

<li>I had my procedure on upper and lower ABS. VASER LIPPO YES!! YES!! At this very moment I, have pain in only ONE area in the a circle around my belly button and a few inches to the right for the most. Very sensative to the touch and hurts 24/7 even to the touch of the compression garmet and sometimes felling numb to dull feel to the touch. 2nd opinion I, talked with my personal doctor he stated the nerve endings near the skin in this area may have been damaged and are very sensative to touch and the compression garmet. I, literally live in my compression garmet (ADVICE TAKEN) I, have to remove now for about 2 to 4 hours ONLY after I come home from the office and apply cold compressions for 30 MIN blocks. It has became non tolerable. If you can locate this item they mimic actual FROZEN PEAS they are inside of a gel pack that can be placed in the freezer to harden and reused. Very convinent and lighter that actual ice or other heavy cold packs. Now my stomach was huge with water moving around inside maybe 1 week post-op after I, got out of the bed one morning. I couldn’t even re-close the compression garmet by noon. I, called the doctor he asked if both of my incisions had completely close with luck one was half open. He advised me to immediately massage in upward motion towards incisions while lying down flat. I, was literally floored how much fluid literally flowed from this tiny opening, and visablly seeing my stomach deflate. WOW! Very thankful I, didn’t face the needle exraction. :&gt;) Note: Was directed by my doctor to come in to the office right after. I, also have been using NIVEA SKIN FIRMING LOTION, NIVEA AGE DEYING MOISTURIZER W/(CREATINE) and 100% RAW REFINED SHEA BUTTER. With this said these products has managed to keep my skin tight and elastic to speed up the condition of my skin. CONCLUSION: CURRENTLY I only notice swelling in the lower abs at this point can feel upper tightening internally when raising ARMS over my head with garmet off.</li>

<li>I had vaser lipo on my abdomen and flank. I have been surprised at how long it is taking to see results. The pain and sensitivity in the skin has gone down quite a bit, and the swelling is slowly improving, but both are still problems. My love handles are noticeably smaller than before, but my lower abdomen still bulges. I suppose this is mostly swelling, at least I hope. I can do some exercise but too much jumping does cause pain in the skin. I am using the compression garment most of the day but usually take it off to sleep. Overall I am happy and trying to be optimistic, but admit it is hard to be patient. I have done some massage but probably not enough. But to answer the question, even at ~5wks post surgery I still have soreness and sensitivity, so I think this is within the range of normal results. BTW I do have one unusual spot of swelling that feels like a small bump, hopefully it will go away with massage or time. It is tighter and more elevated than the area around it. I am due to see the doctor for another follow-up soon, so hopefully he has some insight into this.</li>
<li>I just had vaser liposuction on my abdomen and flanks. Sadly, my abdomen looks like I am 7 months pregnant and I have compression bindee on constantly since surgery a week ago!! My once amazing thighs are now bruised and filled with fluid…..so now I have developed unsightly sretch marks on my upper thighs and saddle bags with a bloated abdomen!!!! I was told post operation only 900cc were extracted to mean 2 pounds of total FAT!! Worse procedure ever!!! I feel spending 5,000.00 to remove only 2 pounds of fat was a complete rip off. Not to mention I will have stretch marks on my once perfect thighs and I did NOT have any work on my hips, thighs or buttocks and I have a huge ass and thighs that are bruised and swollen. ….WHY???? Tomorrow. My binder comes off my abdomen and I am frightened by what I will see since it is swollen like I am pregnant! !! VASER is not something I would recommend to my worst enemy!!!!</li>

<li>I had Vaser on my abdomen and flanks today and was very impressed by the procedure and how I am feeling so far. For me the worst part was standing up right after the procedure because two of my incisions were pouring out the liquid onto the floor. That just seemed a little gross. The surgeon put absorbant pads over the leaky incisions and then helped with my compression wrap. I took a nap for about an hour afterward and only a little had leaked out onto the towel I was lying on. So far, so good. I replaced the pads with new ones and re-tightened the garment. Yes, I am swollen, but at the same time I can see that there will be a noticeable difference when the swelling goes down, and that is very exciting. I have mess for pain, but haven’t needed them yet, and I was already able to walk around and go to the mall. The only bad part about that wasI looked funny in a baggy enough t shirt to go over the compression garment. All in all, it hasn’t even been 12 hours yet, but I feel awesome, can tell that my results are promising, and I am just looking forward to getting rid of the compression in a few weeks because that makes me look bulkier than the swelling itself. Haha.</li>
<li>I’ve had three full days of recovery and no issues at all. Today I got to take my first shower.. I covered the incisions with waterproof bandages and was able to shower with no problems at all. While I was showering I washed and dried my compression garment. It was so nice to not wear it. I could tell the difference between having the support and not, but didn’t feel uncomfortable without it at all. This afternoon I took a nap and when I woke up I was feeling a little itchy. It’s not necessarily the incisions, but the areas around them that are mildly itchy. Also a few spots on my back were itchy, which was funny because the procedure was just my abdomen/flanks. Anyway, itchiness was the only thing discomforting about today, and that’s gone away by now. As far as the incision sites goes, I’m pretty happy they aren’t looking too bad. When I was putting the bandages on them for the shower I actually had a hard time finding two of them because they were barely visible at all! As of now my only inconvenience is still the compression garment. It shows through my existing clothes and gives me a “beer belly” appearance that I didn’t have in the first place. Swelling isn’t bad at all, and bruising is barely noticeable.</li>

<li>Just had my surgery today. Upper and lower abdomen, flanks and back. I have he zipper garments but had to wrap an ace bandage around me as well to make it a bit tighter. Had a major panic attack prior to the tears streaming down mu face, but after a second round of meds I was fine Some discomfort when the probe hit a nerve or two. Very dizzy when I had to get up after the procedure but once I ate something I Was fine. Came home and slept for about 4 hours. I did take a shower because I was soaked from the drainage. Put new bandages on and a clean garment and again wrapped an ace bandage for more compression I will loosen the ace bandage to sleep tonight.</li>
<li>I just had my procedure yesterday… I expected the worst. First I was given all the premeds, a cream on my arms so I did not feel the IV injection, some paracetamol and medication for anxiety. I felt drowsy and during the procedure drifted in and out of sleep..I had 6 litres removed from my Abs and feel great this morning. I can walk around, made myself a cup of tea, I am leaking heaps but will be having a lymphatic drainage massage later today and on Monday…will keep everyone updated how that goes, the amazing thing is I can see the results already and I am well pleased….</li>
<li>So it’s day 9 today. I finished my course of anti-biotics yesterday and I’m now only taking paracetamol before I sleep. I’m off the stronger pain killer. I’m still weak and tired but going for a lymphatic drainage massage today at the gym. I’ve been relying on my husband who massaged me morning and night and this really helps. Also had a hibiscrub bath last night which helped. I just have tiny dressings and the wounds have pretty much closed up. The garment still hurts but I now only have 5 days and I can wear it for 12 hours a day. I don’t have to see the doctor for a few weeks now but I can call using a direct mobile number. It’s all good just want to be able to shop etc.</li>

<li>I had my surgery mid November 2016 and I can say without a doubt it’s the best decision I have made in my life to date ! I had Vaser Liposuction done on my upper/lower abdomen as well as my flanks with a total of 1 litre of fat removed. I was up and walking the next day with minimal discomfort and unbeknownst to my doctor I flew the next day. Apart from the rushed unhooking of buttons from the compression bandages when I have to use the bathroom, it has been relatively smooth sailing for me. The most painful part was the massages which I had almost every day, and even though it’s excruciating to begin with, the pain subsides as you learn to tolerate the discomfort. I liken it to massaging a sore bruise! All in all the whole experience had it’s ups and downs, but the end result was amazing. Granted I only had 1 litre of fat removed but after 6 wks post op I am loving my new figure. I am alot more conscious of what I eat and weigh a tiny 50kgs right now so dieting and excercise is also integral to achieve the results you are looking for. Main tips for all those thinking of taking the step, do your research before you commit to a surgeon, excercise pre/post op, wear your compression garment all the time unless showering… And most importantly , massage the area thoroughly. This is so important to even out the skin tone. Take pain killers if you must but massaging it, no matter how painful the experience, is crucial to your recovery.</li>

<li>I had my procedure just over 3 days ago on hips / outer thights and banana roll (bit at the bottom of buttox) and not sure what I think yet. The procedure wasn’t painful (most uncomfortable bit was having the anaesthetic fluid put in). I wore the compression garment 24/7 for the first two weeks and am now wearing it during the day only for weeks 3 and 4. My outer thighs were absolutely black down to my knee for the first 1.5-2 weeks (I bruise easily so I was told I’d have quite a lot of bruising). The bruising has nearly gone now and I still have some swelling left down the outer thighs. There is no difference yet in shape and my measurements are still exactly the same. I have tried on trousers but no difference in these. I’m trying to be patient as I know it can take weeks to see results but this is difficult when so many people see results within 1-2 weeks.</li>
<li>I am on day three of vaser recovery. The surgeon did my upper and lower abs, flanks and bra rolls. First night after surgery was a bit tough. I leaked a lot, soaking through blue pads, towels and extra sheets! I would say my pain and discomfort was a 5 or 6 on a 1-10 scale. The oxycodone took the edge off, but it sure didn’t eliminate the pain that first night. I could immediately tell that my waist is much smaller, even though I am swollen. My stomach is pretty flat too, at least it appears to be, but I am wearing the compression garment which holds it in somewhat. The second night I was more comfortable. It hurt to try and sit up or roll to get out of bed, but once up I was ok walking around. Third day even better. I am slightly bruised in my groin and shoulderblade area. I took a shower with compression garment on today, then changed into a dry one immediately, no issues. Only time I get any soreness is when I sit or lay for a while and then get up. The lower back is the most sore. My surgeon is excellent and very experienced with the Vaser technique. I have absolutely no regrets at this point! I will continue to update. I do not have before photos, my PS took some. If he will email them to me I will gladly post them with after shots. I would be happy with how I look right now with this garment on, I am so much smaller even swollen as I stated. The amazing part is that I will get even smaller and my skin will be firmer as the days and weeks progress!</li>

<li>Just got my abs, flanks and bra fat done. On day 2 post op and feeling great. My stomach is noticeably smaller. I’ve had ZERO bruising and my swelling went down mostly by day 1. I am tender to the touch (and sort of itchy from my compression binder). It’s hard to sit up and bend over. Also, looking for a new compression garment because the ab binder looks HORRIBLE under clothes. Have you guys tried any good ones? I hate Spanx.</li>
<li>I had vaser lipo done 10 weeks ago. I am still swollen, tender, and numb on both sides around my waistline. I still wear a compression garment around the house and sometimes to sleep in as it feels better. I started using a hand massager on these areas and it seems to help. Before I was just trying to massage the areas myself and it didn’t seem to make any difference. Is there anyone out there that can tell me just how long the numbness, tenderness and swelling could last? I’ve heard that it could last up to 6 months. I really do look much better but find I need to hold my stomach in to make it appear really flat. But, at least I can now do that. Before I had the procedure, I could not hold it in at all.</li>
<li>Wow. That was the weirdest experience of my life. So, as far as these types of procedures go I guess mine went really well according to the doctors. It lasted from 9 AM to 12:30 PM. Having the numbing incisions and the vaser was the most painful part (usually), but having anything inside my body under my skin was extremely uncomfortable and weeeeeeird. I guess since I am muscular too that makes it more painful. Once I was numbed things did not hurt as much and it mainly just felt strange except for the occassional shooting pain when they poked in certain spots! On top of all that lying completely naked on a table in front of my male doctor and his female assistant was the first time for me to be showing off my body in such a vulnerable way. Luckily they were both very professional and supportive, and due to the totally foreign things that were being stuck inside my body, I really didn’t even care that I was butt naked with a man’s hands all over me. So that part, as far as being self-conscious, was not even a big deal and I thought I was going to be very uncomfortable with that. Afterward, I felt totally fine mentally. I felt completely fine during the entire thing and not loopy or high at all. Immediately after they had finished I really needed to go pee, and I just wanted to get up and go. They were concerned I would be nauseous but I felt completely normal and was fine walking around on my own immediately after the surgery was complete. My ride picked me up after a short time relaxing in their recovery room, but I honestly felt like I could have driven myself home. However, they would not let me leave without knowing that I had someone picking me up due to the potential effects of the medicine (dizziness). Now I’m at my hotel. I’ve been here since 1:30 and got all settled in by 2. The procedure was intense and tiring so I did end up taking a long nap, which I wasn’t exactly supposed to do…but whatever. I feel soar, uncomfortable, wet, and gross because of leaking from the incisions, but I feel way better than I thought I would have felt. Even though the procedure was the scariest and most intense thing I have done in my life, it was not unbearable and so far the recovery process has not been bad either. I feel like I could go about my daily normal life right now without too many issues and that I would just be going a bit slower than usual. If it all works out and I heal up really well, the short amount of pain and vulnerability that I experienced today will be totally worth it. I am hoping for the best! Now I’m just taking the medications, trying to walk around (not supposed to sleep or sit too much unless going to bed), and trying to be good to myself. The doc said I should not start to see results until about a week from now, so I’m not worried about the fact that I am super swollen right now. If you guys want pictures of that let me know, otherwise I’m not going to post it because it is grrrrross. Anyways that’s all!</li>
