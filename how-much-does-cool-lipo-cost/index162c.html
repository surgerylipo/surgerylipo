There are different types and forms of liposuction (vaser, laser, traditional, etc) and this can influence the price as well.</p><p>In general, I think it is best to have a consultation with two or three surgeons in your community in order to determine average costs and what form of the procedure would be best for you.</p><p>Remember, cost is not alway the primary concern, especially when you consider that it is major surgery and should be performed by a certified and trained surgeon in an accredited and licensed surgical facility.</p><p>Safety should come first and always will with a qualified and competent plastic surgeon.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_10039" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-fb42a38c06cdbcf9cf17b525cc8a1ffc">

</div><p>To give you some idea: with full anesthesia in a certified surgical facility expect to pay around $2500-4000 for the first area and then a discount for other treatment areas.</p><p>For example (in Jacksonville, Fl), abdominal liposuction with flanks and inner thighs would be considered three areas. This should cost around $4000-6000 for all three and includes anesthesia, and all of your surgical garments. (Erez Sternberg, MD, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The costs associated with liposuction usually will vary depending on one’s geographical area, the experience of the surgeon, and number of areas being treated. Again, although cost is a factor, it is a minor one.</p><p>It is much more important to consider whether or not a surgeon is a board certified, has a good reputation, and is experienced with performing liposuction. (Kelly Gallego, MD, FACS, Yuba City Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The liposuction cost is related to the number of areas you want treated, the amount and complexity of the surgery, the experience of the surgeon, and the anesrhesia needed. A suction of the neck under local anesthesia cost about $2000, whereas liposuction of the abdomen, back and thighs may cost $7000 or more.</p><p>Cool lipo of multiple area does cost less than performing each of the procedures on separate dates, however. My suggestion is not to look for the cheapest place to have an operation on the only body you will ever have.</p><p></p>

</div>Would you buy and use a less than the highest quality parachute? Make every attempt to find a plastic surgeon with years of experience doing liposuction who is board certified. 
<p>Cool lipo is the most popular cosmetic procedure but not the simplest to do with finese.</p><p>It takes careful planning, lots of experience, and an artistic flair to achieve a result that is smooth, attractive, and is in harmony with the rest of your body. (E. Ronald Finger, MD, Savannah Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Cool lipo of the chin/jawline/neck may be done under local anesthesia alone, with very quick recovery time and wonderful early results that continue to improve for 6 to 12 months post-operatively. The cost for the procedure when done in this manner is $2740.</p><p>Intravenous sedation, often referred to as “twilight sleep” – where you are sleepy and unaware of any discomfort at all, may also be added. (Michael R. Macdonald, MD, Bay Area Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The choice of an experienced BOARD CERTIFIED PS is the most important. Cost can vary. Good relationship with the PS, trust, expertise, availability are cost is important. Most plastic surgeons will fall in the same ballpark.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_10042" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>$4K to $5k per area inclusive all less for the second and third area. (Samir Shureih, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Cost of Cool lipo Montreal</strong></p><p>The cost of cool lipo can vary greatly from one clinic to the next in a large city like Montreal. Cool lipo should be performed by a board-certified plastic surgeon as this procedure is part of the extensive (6+ years) of post medical school training received by plastic surgeons.</p><p>That is not the case for most other specialties. Unfortunately, liposuction is often performed by non-plastic surgeons and even non-surgeons, including family doctors.</p><p>This too will have an effect on cost since the only way for other doctors to compete with certified plastic surgeons is to lower their prices.</p><p>However, price is only a minor factor to consider before undergoing any cosmetic surgery. Shopping for a bargain is not a good idea when it comes to your face or body.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_10043" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>In Montreal liposuction done by a certified plastic surgeon can cost as little as $2500.00 if done under local anesthesia.</p><p>If it is done in a full operating room in a hospital or private facility with an anesthetist present, the overall fee will start at around $4000.00 for one area and each additional area treated will add $1500 – $2000.00 to the cost. (Arie Benchetrit, MD, Montreal Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of liposuction varies widely from surgeon to surgeon. I typically charge about $4000 for the first area treated and about $1500 for each additional area. That being said, there is a big difference between performing liposuction on a patient with a BMI (body mass index) of 22 and one with a BMI of 30.</p><p>Each patient is different and the cost of the procedure really ends up being directly related to how long the procedure will take to perform.

</div><p>Cool lipo cost varies based on the amount of areas and whether the procedure is performed in the office or in the operating room.</p><p>On average, the cost of 2-3 areas of liposuction in our office ranges from $ 5500.00-8,000.00 including surgeon cost and facility/supply fee. (Robert Heck, MD, FACS, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>We offer discounts when patients have multiple areas of liposuction.

</div><p>Generally cost decreases when more than one are is treated at a time. For example, First area may be $4400, second area $2250, third area $1500. I have seen crazy pricing structures – where the practice will say “$999” per area – when they are dividing the abdomen up into 3 separate areas.</p><p>In my opinion, the entire abdomen should be done as one unit unless there are real extenuating circomstances. You shouldn’t look for the cheapest deal for liposuction. The cost will mirror the experience and expertise of the surgeon.</p><p>You should look for a doctor with significant experience and training. They should also have a good stable team of nurses with experience, good before and after images, and previous patients that you can call.

</div><p>Cool lipo prices vary alot for alot of reasons. One is geographical area. Some parts of the country are more expensive than other parts of the country. Many large metropolitan areas at either coast, east coast or west coast are generally more expensive than southern or central parts of the country.</p><p>Also the price varies with the area you want treated or the number of areas. The more areas, the more it will cost you.</p><p>That said, I would estimate the starting price for liposuction of one area would be in the range of $2,500 and up. (James Tang, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Cool lipo Costs and Prices</b></p><p>There is a wide range of costs, both from one region of the country to another, and even within a given area.

</div><p>It would be nice if you could assume that a specific price or price level will provide a guarantee for a specific result but it is unfortunately not possible to do that. The other issue is whether this is a relatively smaller procedure, and/or one that can be performed under local anesthesia alone, or if it is a larger one, in which case you can anticipate greater costs (for the anesthesia, for the facility fee, if applicable).</p><p>In New York, a smaller liposuction can sometimes be performed starting at about $3500.00; the more extensive the procedure, the more expensive it is likely to be. Larger amounts and more areas will increase the costs so that a lipo of several areas (for example, stomach, hips and thighs) is likely to cost, with anesthesia and facility fees, up to $10,000, or more. (Alan M. Engler, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cool lipo cost in Baltimore, Maryland</h3><p>Total cost for liposuction is a combination of: Surgeon’s fee + iv-sedation (twilight) anesthesia + facility + garment</p><p>In my Baltimore Facility total cost range depends on the area(s) of liposuction.

In general, the cost of abdominal and flank liposuction in Orange County varies from 3000 to 5000 dollars.</p><p>Doing multiple areas is cost effective with less fees than 1 area alone. (Robert M. Wald, Jr., MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Cool lipo cost depends on treatment area</strong></p><p>Cool lipo, or suction assisted lipectomy, is a safe procedure when performed in experienced hands.</p><h3>The cost of cool liposuction depends on three factors:</h3><ul>
<li>Professional fees per area of treatment</li>
<li>Anesthesia type and cost of an anesthesiologist</li>
<li>Surgery center fees</li>

</div><p>I do not compromise on the quality of the surgery center or the presence of a board certified anesthesiologist. These two factors influence the safety of the surgery and the price of the procedure altogether. (Raffy Karamanoukian, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Lipo prices vary widely and are the last issue in choosing your doctor</b></p><p>There are no standard fees for liposuction or any other cosmetic surgery for that matter. The price is an issue in today’s economy but make that the last determinant of where you go. Remember that the best results are those that are done ONCE with no revisions.</p><p>Revisions never get to the same level of result as if it went well the first time and it will cost you more if you have to go to another doctor to make it better.</p><p>So go to the best doctor, not the cheapest, in the first place. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>We have a quote: $ 8989 for surgeon’s fees, 4 hours of OR time, and anesthesia in a Chicago Hospital ( i.e. fully staffed by MD’s and nurses ). this is for liposuction of your entire mid-section: front of abdomen from under the bra, pubis, entire back and flanks, with fat transfer to buttocks ( BBL ). (Florence Mussat, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The fee for liposuction depends on much liposuction is performed. The time spent in the operating room determines the cost of surgical procedures. The longer the procedure, the higher the fees. In the Omaha area, the price range is from $3,000-$5,000.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_10040" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>Make sure your surgeon is Board Certified in Plastic Surgery.</p><p>You do not want your surgery done by a doctor who is a dermatologist, dentist, Ophthalmologist, OB/GYN, ER Doc, Family Practice, etc.</p><p>Any one can perform liposuction and call themselves a COSMETIC SURGEON, but that does not mean that they have undergone the proper training and have the experience to perform the procedure safely, choose your surgeon wisely. (David Finkle, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Lipo Cost is frequently hard to explain</h3><p>Cool lipo cost is frequently hard to explain. This is probably because many types of doctors offer liposuction and their costs of doing business are not the same. Cool lipo can also be performed in low cost settings (like an office) or higher cost places (like a surgical center.)</p><p>The bottom line is that you are value shopping like for anything else. If you choose the cheaper option often you are being operated under numbing alone (more uncomfortable) by the less experienced doctor or by the non-plastic surgeon.</p><p>Beware that some of the mistakes an inexperienced or poorly trained surgeon will make cannot be fixed. You need to decide what is important to you. (John P. Di Saia, MD, Orange Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Cool lipo of the abdomen, anterior flanks, and posterior flanks is a two hour procedure as it requires to prep and drape the front and back of the patient.</p><ol>
<li>Professional fee: $3000</li>
<li>Medicare approved Facitity fee: $1500</li>
<li>Anesthesia fee MD/DO: $900</li>
<li>Total $5400</li>
</ol><p>A three hour procedure involving additional areas costs about $1800 more. (George C. Peck, Jr, MD, West Orange Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
