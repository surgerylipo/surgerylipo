<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>The cost of Smart Lipo varies widely based on the following factors.</p><p><strong>A. Where is the surgery being performed?</strong></p><p>1. Certified surgical suite will create an additional fee also called facility fee. This is for your added safety. Facility fees usually will add 1,000 to the total cost.<br>
2. Exam rooms, on certified procedure rooms – often no facility fee, but you are taking chances with developing complications.</p><p><strong>B. What type of laser is being used for Smart Lipo?</strong></p><p>1. There is only one “Smart Lipo” on the market made by Cynosure. They invented laser liposuction. Their device creates the most skin tightening, least downtime and is currently the safest product on the market.</p><p>The latest version of Smart Lipo is called Smart Lipo Triplex. You will pay a little more for this superior technology. It is well worth it.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2114" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d8ace6a67b21721f2ef7d633adea7cca">

</div><p>2. Other inferior brands: Won’t get the same results but will pay less. Beware of physicians using the “Smart Lipo ” name to lure you in only to use some other brand.</p><p>Always ask to see the device and make sure you they are using what they are claiming to have.</p><p><strong>C. Who is performing the surgery?</strong></p><ol>
<li>Board certified plastic surgeon (body) or facial plastic surgeon (face)- the cost will be higher for a plastic surgery specialist for that body area.</li>
<li>Non plastic surgeons tend to charge a lot less. Beware of rock bottom pricing and physicians saying “board certified”- board certified in what? Eye doctors, OBGYN’s, pediatricians and internists are all performing liposuction and laser liposuction these days.</li>

</div><p><strong>D. Which part of your body and how many areas. </strong></p><p>Typical fees from plastic surgeons using Smart Lipo in a certified surgical suite.</p><ol>
<li>J<strong>aw line and neck – </strong> typically 3500 $</li>
<li>
<strong>Upper & Lower Abdomen</strong> – 5000  $</li>
<li>
<strong>Arms</strong> – 5,000  $</li>
<li>
<strong>Thighs inner and outer</strong> – 5,000  $</li>
<li>
<strong>Additional areas same day will add to the cost</strong>. (Ran Y. Rubinstein, MD, Manhattan Facial Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ol><p>Smartlipo is priced by the areas needed to be treated. A rough estimate of an area is what is covered by 2 hands. An abdomen for example, is 3 areas: upper, lower abdomen and love handles. Of course, some people have more fat and loose skin than others.</p><p>So the cost per area will vary among individuals. If performed safely under local anesthesia, the smartlipo cost should be much less as the expense of general anesthesia is avoided. (Lawrence Broder, MD, Cedar Park Family Physician)</p><p>There is flat rates or marketing smartlipo prices that you can receive over the phone. At our spa we charge per area and give the best pricing over a complementary tour and consultation! I feel it is better go in and meet with your doctor and medical staff at the location you are interested in receiving the procedure at, so you can feel comfortable and welcomed! 🙂 and no the amount of fat that is melted down and suctioned does not affect the cost of the procedure at all! (Chaitali Nangrani, MD, The Woodlands Family Physician)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2116" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-6f8aea5cdbde67a63ea22f9daf78966e">

</div><p>There are many different fee structures and vary from doctor to doctor. For the holidays, in my office, Tickle Lipo (Nutational Infrasonic Liposculpture) costs $2500 per area (on sale). For instance the Abdomen is one area, the Flanks are another.</p><p>Small areas like the pubic fat pad is $500. There are no anesthesia or additional fees except oral medications. Different liposuction techniques adding ThermiTight radiofrequency or laser like Smart Lipo can have some additional skin tightening benefits.</p><p>By itself these add-on’s are not sufficient to achieve body contouring and require some regular liposuction, especially if the client is average to over weight. If the client is lean and only desires minor or modest body contouring they are the perfect candidate for Smart Lipo only. (LeRoy Yates, MD, FACOG, Davenport OB/GYN)</p><p><amp-img class="size-medium wp-image-2117 amp-wp-unknown-size amp-wp-unknown-width amp-wp-unknown-height amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2017/08/index.html" alt="Laser-assisted Liposuction Uses Laser Energy" width="600" height="400" layout="fixed"></amp-img></p><h4>Smart Lipo cost in Plano and Dallas area</h4><p>Smart Lipo treatment at our Center in Plano is quoted on the basis of the number of surgical areas treated, so it will vary from patient to patient. In general, to the date of this answer, our charges are $1249 per area treated, which for the abdomen means two, for the outer thighs also two areas.</p><p>Patients who are overweight are not candidates for this treatment as Smart Lipo is more about shape than weight loss. (Mario Diana, MD, Plano Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>we have the SmartLipo Triplex in both our Tampa and Orlando offices. There are many answers for and against the technology. I would just like to say that the most important thing is the doctor performing the surgery.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2118" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>You can have the best technology in the world but if it is not used correctly, you are not going to get good results. The benefits of SmartLipo is that it makes it easier to remove the fat, decreases the amount fo bleeding and bruising and stimulates the collagen to improve skin tightening.</p><p>The Triplex has the advantage over previous version in that the 1440 wavelength is the most specific wavelength for fat and also procduces the least amount of thermal energy, thus decreasing the chance of burns. I perform all my SmartLipo under local anesthesia with oral sedation.</p><p>Patients do great. When patients want a lot of areas done, we usually break it up over 2 days. This way it can still be done under local anesthesia and avoid the risks of general anesthesia.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2124" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-614c45bb03f5a1ab883cf69378a6c227">

</div><p>As far as pricing goes, we charge $3500 for one area. We offer discount packages for multiple areas. (Rigo Mendoza, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Smart Lipo cost: Fees for any procedure can vary widely</h4><p>There are many factors that come into play when having liposuction. One factor includes whether the surgeon is a board certified surgeon, or even a a surgeon for that matter. It can also depend on whether liposuction (such as power assisted liposuction or vaser) are going to be performed along with the procedure.</p><p>Try to get several opinions from several board certified plastic surgeons who are members of ASAPS prior to making your decision. (Sanjay Grover, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Price varies per area</b></p><p>Different doctors evaluate the areas for liposuction in different ways. In our practice we consider the liposuction per areas. For example in average, the abdomen is four areas, the back is six areas, the waist is two areas, the arms are two areas and it goes on.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2120" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>In general the price in our practice is more per areas than per the amount of fat that is removed. In the state of Florida we have a restriction where we can only remove four liters of fat. (Cesar Velilla, MD, Miami Internist)</p><p>The cost of Smart Lipo varies depending on several factors: such as size of area, amount of fat that needs to be aspirated, age, body type, etc. You definitely want to book a consultation with a provider in your area, who will be able to better answer this question. (Radhika Mohandas, MD, Monterey Family Physician)</p><p><i>SmartLipo in San Diego</i></p><p>Although the price of liposuction can vary tremendously, in places where you have more options, ie. Southern California, the costs can be more reasonable, since there is cost-competition. That being said, it is true that the cost should reflect the skill and experience of the surgeon more than any gimmick that is being used.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2121" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Many physicians believe that SmartLipo does not add enough benefit to justify the additional cost, which can be substantial. There are a few situation where it may be of additional benefit, however, a skilled surgeon will provide you with excellent results regardless.</p><p>Unfortunately, some surgeons will push the SmartLipo without proper justification over regular liposuction. The cost of liposuction should depend on the area being treated and less so on the amount of fat being removed. Typically, an abdominal lipo should cost around $5000 (give or take) and areas such as the thighs will be around $3000.</p><p>Make sure that the cost is not artificially low, unless there is a specific promotion underway, and that the person actually performing the procedure is the person advertised, and not an associate. Although I do not charge an initial consultation fee, some physicians do.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2122" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d8ace6a67b21721f2ef7d633adea7cca">

</div><p>This is not always advertised, but it can also add to the cost of the procedure. Also make sure that there are no “hidden” fees, such as for labs, garments, etc. which can also add up. (Reza Tirgari, MD, San Diego Physician)</p><p>Having done literally thousands of both traditional lipo cases for twenty years and Smartlipo cases for ten years, I can tell you that the way surgeons charge is as varied as the fish in the sea.</p><p>Some factors are the market in which you live, the specialty of the surgeon, whether or not it’s done in an office setting or a hospital or surgery canter, whether general anesthesia is used, etc.</p><p>I can tell you that qualified surgeons who work in their offices using local tumescent anesthesia have an incredibly good safety record, and their cost will be the least with the least risk. I personally charge solely by the area, no matter how large or small, because it all balances out in the end.</p><p>Above all do your research into the experience of the operator, and don’t be afraid to ask the questions about cost, anesthesia, facility, etc.</p><p>One more note: Having done thousands of each type of procedure (traditional and Smartlipo) there is no doubt in my mind that the laser makes the entire procedure easier on both patient and operator, and the resultant tightening is undeniable with the laser added.</p><p>Any “laser burn”pictures you may see are from bad operators or are dated, because the newer machines have an automatic sensor which stops the laser when the tissue temperature gets too hot. The laser does cost a lot, but in my own decades-long experience with both methods it’s well worth the cost.</p><p>I charge no more since adding the laser than I did with no laser used. (Robert W. Benson, MD, Hammond Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Prices for any time of liposuction can vary widely, given that it is a technique to remove unwanted fat. This can vary from a 30 minute procedure to remove unwanted fat from a double chin to a 4 hour procedure to sculpt a sizeable stomach or back.</p><p>There is a fixed cost, as the equipment is expensive, so there is a cost benefit to doing all the desired areas in one session. I do all my smartlipo cases under local and tumescent anesthesia , so there is a limit as to how many body areas can be numbed up with local anesthesia at one setting.</p><p>The amount of local anesthesia that can be given at one time depends on the patient’s body weight. Our prices can vary from $1500 (double chin) to $8500 – for the maximum that can be done in 1 day.</p><p>I am very aggressive because no patient has ever complained that I took too much fat out, yet! The exact cost can be given to a prospective patient, once the patient is examined and the extent of the desired procedure is discussed.</p><p>We are getting awesome results without general anesthesia, minimal down time and minimal recovery.
