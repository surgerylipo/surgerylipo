<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>So many patients ask whether Smart Lipo or Traditional lipo is better. Smart lipo uses laser energy to help melt fat, and then it is either left for the body to absorb or is suctioned out.</p><p>Regular liposuction uses a blunt tube to suction out the fat.</p><p>Both can result in tighter skin, but your skin quality before surgery has more to do with this than the type of machine used.</p><p>Also, in the wrong hands, laser lipo can result in burns to the skin which leave permanent scars (I have seen patients from other practices with this issue).</p><p>So what it really boils down to is picking the best surgeon, not the best technique.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3558" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>That is for your surgeon to decide. Here are some guidelines to picking a great surgeon.</p><p>#1. TRAINING – If they are are trained in “cosmetic” surgery or medicine, this almost always means they are NOT a board certified plastic surgeon.</p><p>They are most likely an ophthalmologist, anesthesiologist, internist, or ER physician who has trained in a weekend course or at best a one year long apprenticeship on doing liposuction and other cosmetic procedures.</p><p>Plastic surgeons have years of surgical training, and board certified surgeons have been examined to make sure they are knowledgeable, ethical, and safe.</p><p></p>

Berman, MD, Sterling Plastic Surgeon</p>
</div>#2. RESULTS – Look at a lot of before and after pictures. Make sure to look at the patients’ other body parts in the photos as well to make sure that liposuction, and not overall weight loss, is responsible for the result.
<p>Look carefully at the lighting and angles, which can make a big difference in photos. Also, make sure to clarify the revision policy so you know what your financial obligations are if you are not happy with the outcome.</p><p>#3. EXPERIENCE – Ask how many liposuction procedures are performed per month and how many patients are satisfied with their results.</p><p>#4. BEWARE OF HEAVY ADVERTISING – If the physician is really pushing a technology, often it is because the investment is big, and the physician needs to recoup.</p><p>It would be more trustworthy if a surgeon offered multiple types of liposuction and recommended Smart Lipo in your particular case because in their experience it is helpful given your type of anatomy and skin quality. (Dana Goldberg, MD, Jupiter Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3560" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d8ace6a67b21721f2ef7d633adea7cca">

</div><p><b>Benefits of Smartlipo</b></p><p>I have been using Smartlipo for many years and I have personally seen that the results with this technology are better than the results that I was seeing with traditional liposuction alone. The steps that I use are to infuse wetting solution (tumescent solution) into an area to be treated.</p><p>This is followed by Smartlipo laser treatment to the subcutaneous fat. Then I perform power-assisted liposuction using small caliber cannulas. </p><p>This sequence is more time-consuming that traditional liposuction alone, but the results that I have seen have been very good and certainly better than just traditional liposuction.</p><p>The main benefit that I have seen for my patients who undergo Smartlipo is that the laser treatment to the fat produces a more liquefied aspirate and the area can be contoured more thoroughly and with less force.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3561" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The Smartlipo laser energy, if used to excess, can cause problems to the skin and to the subcutaneous tissues. I have found that use of the laser on low energy settings is safe and effective.</p><p>Any surgical instrument or technology has the potential to cause harm, and patients should consider the qualifications, board certification, and experience of their plastic surgeon before undergoing a procedure. (George Chatson, MD, Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I have used many different machines and my experience with laser liposuction has been so beneficial in the reduction in bruising, swelling and pain in comparison to traditional liposuction.</p><p>With the technology available today, such as the Smartlipo I would not recommend anything else to my patients. Keep in mind the results of Smartlipo are reflective of the skills of the surgeon. (Jeff Angobaldo, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3562" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><em>SmartLipo versus traditional liposuction</em></p><p>Sometimes surgeons are prejudiced as to what procedures they recommend based on what laser devices and equipment they actually have available. Personally, I have been doing laser-assisted SmartLipo as well as conventional liposuction for many, many years.</p><p>I actually find that COMBINING the two concepts works better than either single modality alone, especially if you have loose skin areas. In general, conventional liposuction does a better job at “debulking” large areas of unwanted fat.</p><p>SmartLipo does a better job at “tightening” skin so that it “shrink wraps” after large volumes of fat are removed. (Windell C. Davis-Boutte, MD, Atlanta Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>The difference between SmartLipo and traditional liposuction is during SmartLipo a laser cannula is introduced after tumescent fluid is injected before suction begins. This laser is targeted at reducing trauma, bleeding and swelling and tightening skin.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3563" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>In some areas such as the breast and upper back which are very fibrous and tough, SmartLipo is superior. SmartLipo is also excellent when trying to achieve more skin tightening. (Laura Gunn, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In recent years there have been many new technologies, which fall into two categories of either laser-assisted liposuction such as Smart Lipo, or ultrasonic liposuction such as Vaser. Along with these new technologies are aggressive marketing efforts which are alarming to me because it means that patients are trusting the machine instead of the doctor.</p><p>It is more important how well the sculpting is done and less important what tools are used. Remember, it is the sculpting that matters most. In other words, the brush is not the important thing.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3564" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d8ace6a67b21721f2ef7d633adea7cca">

</div><p>It is more about the skills, eyes, artistry, and judgment of the Surgeon. Think about it: are painters that much better today than Rembrandt was hundreds of years ago just because there are better paintbrushes out there? All that said last year I did incorporate the new Smart Lipo Triplex system into my practice as I did like the the increased control and feedback over the old system.</p><p>I utilize it in specific ways on specific patients but as expected it has not dramatically improved on my already consistently optimized results. Once again itbis onlyba tool. I find it beneficial in some of the revision work I do to thermally release scar tissue.</p><p>It can also thermally emulsify fat if I want to to be more aggressive in a particular area but this is where a surgeon without good judgement can make a mistake by being to aggressive in the wrong area.</p><p>I also utilize for additional thermal tightening of the skin where I may want that, but once again one has to be careful and use good judgement and technique as too much tightening in the wrong area such as thin upper inner thigh skin with reduced elasticity can create surface irregularities. Once again experience, judgement, artistry. (David Amron, MD, Beverly Hills Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><b>There are no documented benefits of SmartLipo for liposuction.</b></p><p>Tumescent liposuction has by far the best track record for safety and excellent results. In New York City, that’s what the expert plastic surgeons use. SmartLipo is mostly about marketing with no evidence. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There are many options available for liposuction. Although tumescent liposuction is tried and true, some patients may require additional procedures with laser energy or ultrasound energy to emulsify and destroy fat cells during the procedure.</p><p>I employ all three methods in my practice based on individual characteristics. All three procedures can acheive outstanding results. (Raffy Karamanoukian, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>High technology offers advantages</i></p><p>We currently perform SmartLipo, Vaser Lipo and Tumcescent Lipo, none of which require general anesthesia. If someone does not have the technology they will call it a gimmick and others tell you to see specialists such as themselves for procedures because they are better.</p><p>Biased physicians who do not answer your questions should be avoided. SmartLipo and now about six other brands of Lipolysis lasers do have advantages in doing small fat deposits, minor touch ups and revisions. Usually, when done, you are getting a small dose of conventional lipo as well.</p><p>Vaser also adds ease and quicker recovery to the procedure. If you are interested in minimally invasive techniques for quick recovery do seek out a lipo doc who embraces advanced technology. (Richard D. Gentile, MD, Youngstown Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Results depend more on surgeon than liposuction type</h3><p>Studies have been performed comparing the two techniques. One study compared patients who had “smart” liposuction done on one side, and traditional liposuction done on the other by the same surgeon.</p><p>There was no appreciable difference in the results. More important is your surgeon’s experience with the technique. (James C. Grotting, MD, FACS, Birmingham Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Smart Lipo is part gimmick.</i></p><p>In the last year I worked with a marketing group and did about 150 Smart Lipo procedures. I have done “regular” tumescent lipo for over ten years. The difference is pretty small in the average patient, but the cost difference can be substantial.</p><p>It may work better than “regular” lipo in redos or in “Lipo only” gynecomastia reductions. Be careful in trying to compare here. (John P. Di Saia, MD, Orange Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
