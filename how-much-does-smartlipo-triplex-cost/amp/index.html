<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>The cost of a Smart Lipo Triplex procedure depends mainly on which and how many areas of the body are being treated. First and foremost, make sure the person with whom you are discussing this procedure is an expert in both lasers and liposuction.</p><p>Liposuction performed by dermatologists is not new; we actually were the first group of doctors to adopt the technology many years ago.</p><p>Derms invented the tumescent, or local anesthetic technique, and many of us are well-versed in liposuction and some of us are also well versed in lasers.</p><p>When we discuss costs, we normally start at approximately $3,000 for the first area and then add fees based on what else is being treated – with some reductions with each additional area since we are already working in the areas.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_11013" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>You need to discuss fees – including if there is a facility fee or an anesthetic fee; this can raise the price substantially. Also know there are non-invasive alternatives now available — for some.</p><p>The cost of SmartLipo Triplex is highly variable depending on the experience of the surgeon, geographic location, amount of time involved and size of the area treated.</p><p>It can generally range from $2,500 to $4,500 per area or region (i.e.: upper abdomen, lower abdomen, love handles, hips, lateral thighs, etc. are all different areas).</p><p>If most doctors in your area are charging around the same price but then you find one doctor that is dramatically lower, then you might need to worry that it might be too good to be true and perhaps the reason that doctor is charging so low has to do with less skill or experience performing the procedure.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_11014" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Most important questions to ask of the doctor before deciding to do the procedure are: how many years has the doctor been performing the procedure and how many patients has the doctor treated, see before and after photos, ask about complications and redo rate.</p><p>Some doctors have a high redo rate because they don’t take their time to do the procedure right in the first place. And you should find out ahead of time if there is a charge for redos.</p><p>Many doctors do not disclose that they would charge you again if they had to redo. (M. Christine Lee, MD, Walnut Creek Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>They are CoolSculpting and UltraShape — and they have successfully treated many who wanted Smart Lipo and were not candidates or who want something less invasive. (Michael Gold, MD, Nashville Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_11015" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Smartlipo Triplex starts at $2500 for 1st area and $1000 for each additional area. With Smartlipo Triplex skin tightening may typically have an additional charge. (Arthur M. Cambeiro, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There have been many different generations of Smart Lipo Triplex. The latest is the triplex which adds a third laser wave length a 1440. Studies show that the 1440 has more effective fat “break up”. this allows for faster more effective treatments.</p><p>It is also safer as it monitors the temperature and speed at which the doctor performs the procedure.</p><p>So before you look at cost other factors need to be taken into consideration: What generation Smart Lipo is the doctor using? Where is the procedure being performed? I only perform it in a nationally accredited surgical center.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_11016" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>How is the doctor removing the fat? I use the aqualipo system that gently removes the fat using the power of water. Does the doctor himself perform the procedure? Cost does vary per area, but runs approximately $3000 for the first and $2000 for each additional area. (Mark Berkowitz, MD, Sterling Heights Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Smart Lipo Cost Albany NY</strong></p><p>The cost for liposuction will depend on the size of the area that needs to be treated. I typically charge $2500 to $3500 for one area. Of course, if you have a very small area to be treated the cost can be less. (Sanjiv Kayastha, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Fat remove relates to cost of the procedure</h3><p>I have been performing Smart Lipo for the past year and my patients have been very happy with the results. I normally charge by the area (range from $1000 to $3000 depending on the size of the area) and a set up fee.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_11017" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I perform all my Smarlipo procedures under local anesthesia. The patient returns to work within a day with minimal down time and bruising. (Mytien Goldberg, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>With liposuction I price per area in my practice. An area is always bilateral meaning if you are requiring smart liposuction to the inner thighs it is priced as one area for both thighs.</p><p>If you would like to add additional areas the cost is then discounted per each additional area added. I do not base my cost off of the amount of fat removed as I feel you deserve the best possible outcome.</p><p>Your cost is all inclusive with no additional fees. (Ronald Downs, MD, FACS, South Bend Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost depends on the surgeon, but it’s usually based on the number of areas you have done, as well as what those areas are (larger areas, like the love handles, are usually more expensive than smaller areas like under the chin).</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_11018" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The amount of fat removed doesn’t usually affect the price. (Michael Constantin Gartner, DO, Paramus Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>There is usually a flat fee for the first area being addressed.</h4><p>Each subsequent area cost slightly less so it does make sense to address a few areas in one setting. The amount of fat removed does not usually alter the fee for the procedure. (Leila Kasrai, MD, FRCSC, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I have specialized in lipo for almost 20 years and have always emphasized the experience and artistry of the surgeon rather then what particular tool or machine he uses to perfect his results. That said I incorporated the new smart lipo triplex system last year.</p><p>I utilize it in specific patients in specific ways to achieve a desired outcome an find it a slight advantage in revision patients, patients where I choose to get maximal retraction of skin, patients where I choose to get further thermal emulsification or melting of fat and revision patients who may have a lot of scar tissue.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_11019" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>With regard to cost I personally charge by the time the surgery takes me which most commonly is related to the surface area being done. My surgical fees range from $3000 to approximately $6000 per surgery. As smart lipo takes a bit longer and has increased costs there is usually a 15% up charge. (David Amron, MD, Beverly Hills Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>In my practice we have general set costs depending on the area to be treated. As no two patients are exactly the same, and some patients need significantly more suctioning that others, there can be some cost differences involved between patients.</p><p>A personal consult with your Board Certified Plastic Surgeon will be the best way to get your cost determined. (Brian Howard, MD (retired), Alpharetta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>How much does Smartlipo cost?</i></p><p>I have been using Smartlipo MPX and Triplex since early 2009, over three years now. Having accumulated a great deal of experience, I find that the latest technical developments using the 1440 wavelength and the Cellulaze SideLase fibers have resulted in excellent outcomes for my patients.</p><p>For example, a woman with some loose skin of the abdomen, a common condition, will not get any skin tightening with tradition liposuction. Using the SmartlipoTriplex with the ThermaGuide, heat can be applied to shrink the skin.</p><p>The ThermaGuide allows the precise application of heat to the under-surface of the skin since the laser computer registers the instantaneous skin temperature and can be programmed to shut off slightly above the therapeutic range, usually 45-47 degrees Centigrade.</p><p>There is a new upgrade to the Smartlipo Triplex, the Cellulaze, used in the long-term treatment of cellulite. Using the Cellulaze side-firing fiber, even more precision in the application of heat is possible, with the same built-in safety features.</p><p>The SideLase fiber is directional, allowing heat to be directed primarily to the under-surface of the skin. At the end of a Smartlipo Triplex procedure, the subdermal skin temperature can be methodically elevated to 45-47 degrees.</p><p>Skin contraction continues for six months, according to the Cellulaze studies, and should be the same when applied to other areas. These latest devices are not the same as the old Smartlipo that any doctor could buy.</p><p></p>

</div></center><p>The Cellulaze is being sold only to board-certified plastic surgeons. In the hands of an experienced board-certified plastic surgeons, using ThermaGuide, the chance of experiencing a thermal injury or burn, should be extremely small. When used for body contouring, the most important factor is the skill of the surgeon.</p><p>I think that Smarlipo Triplex adds an excellent tool in the hands of a board-certified plastic surgeon. Having twenty years of experience with traditional, vaser ultrasonic and Smartlipo Triplex assisted liposuction, I would say the each is effective in good hands and each has particular applications.</p><p>Smartlipo Triplex and Cellulaze procedures are very well tolerated in the office operating room with oral sedation and no need, in my hands, for any IV or inhalation anesthesia. The patients are comfortable during the procedure and are able to get up and go home with a responsible adult after the procedure.</p><p>Because of the multiple steps required, marking, prepping, draping, infiltration of tumescent anesthesia, application of laser energy to the deep and superficial fat layers, removal of the liquefied fat with special non-traumatic cannulas, and then skin heating, this is a tedious and somewhat involved process.</p><p>It is relatively expensive in terms of time and resources, including the very expensive laser equipment. We price Smartlipo by area and how much fat will be removed, since larger areas take longer. However, even small abdomens require all the steps enumerated above and require special care to bring out the underlying anatomy, retain normal skin thickness and tighten the skin.</p><p>Current pricing as of July, 2017, starts at 4500 for one area, e.g. abdomen, inner or outer thighs, and 6,500 for an area or equivalent to all around the abdomen, waist and flanks. Included is a Cosmetassure cosmetic insurance policy that we purchase for every patient undergoing a covered cosmetic procedure such as liposuction.</p><p>Cellulaze treatment for cellulite is 4000 for the first area, bilaterally, then 2500 for each additional area. Treating cellulite all around the thighs is usually three areas, so patient cost is between 4000 and 9,000. (Robert M. Lowen, MD, Mountain View Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
