<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>The decision between doing liposuction on the abdomen or a tummy tuck (abdominoplasty) is one you should make in conjunction with your board-certified plastic surgeon. The appearance of your abdomen is dependent on the skin, muscle and subcutaneous tissue (fat).</p><p>While you can get some tightening of the skin with liposuction, it mostly just addresses the excess fat cells. An abdominoplasty can address the loose skin and tighten muscles that have spread, but results from an abdominoplasty are best when you have minimal excess fat to treat.</p><p>There are some situations in which you can have both liposuction and an abdominoplasty, but again, make sure you are discussing this with your board certified plastic surgeon. (Jason Brett Lichten, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5399" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>Although these procedures are sometimes combined in certain cases, each procedure usually treats a different group of patients. Liposuction is ideal for younger patients with good skin tone of the abdomen, who are near or at their ideal weight, and who have very little laxity in the fascia of the abdominal muscles.</p><p>Patients who benefit from tummy tucks usually have minimal fat excess, moderate to severe amounts of extra skin, and stretching of the abdominal muscles and connective tissue. (Kelly Gallego, MD, FACS, Yuba City Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction is fine when a patient has fat deposits right underneath the skin surface, and the skin & muscles underneath are in good condition. A tummy tuck is necessary when a woman has loose & stretched out skin skin and the muscle underneath separates.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5400" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>A tummy tuck will correct all mentioned issues. From a recovery standpoint, liposuction has a slightly faster recovery time 5 days to a week.</p><p>With a tummy tuck, because the incision is longer, recovery time lasts about 2 – 2.5 weeks. (Usha Rajagopal, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Abdominal Liposuction vs. Tummy Tuck</h4><p>Abdominal liposuction is not the same as a tummy tuck. Liposuction reduces fat. An ideal candidate for liposuction are not obese, and do not have skin or abdonimal muscle laxity. Tummy tuck procedure removes excess skin and fat and can tighten lax abdominal muscle. (Robert Sleightholm, MD, Brampton Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Don”t be fooled: liposuction is not an alternative to a tummy tuck</i></p><p>There is one common theme between liposuction and tummy tuck, which is removal of localized fat that is resistant to change with diet and exercise. If that is all you have and the skin tone is good then lipo is the way to go.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5401" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>If there is skin laxity, perhaps with stretch marks after pregnancy, and/or if the muscles have been pushed apart by pregnancy, these will not improve with exercise or liposuction.</p><p>There is a lot of marketing hype about the use of technologies such as laser with lipo to tighten the skin, but none of them come close to doing enough to subsitute for abdominoplasty. (Richard Baxter, MD, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Are tummy tuck and liposuction the same thing?</b></p><p>No, tummy tuck (abdominoplasty) and liposuction are not the same thing. A standard tummy tuck removes the skin and fat along the lower abdomen, tightens the abdominal (rectus abdominus) muscles and advances the upper abdominal skin to cover the lower abdomen.</p><p>A umbilicoplasty is also performed. Liposuction removes fat under the skin in both deep (preferred) and superficial (if needed) layers. Depending on the patient, they can be used in conjunction called lipoabdominplasty. When your plastic surgeon assess you he/she will make a determination on how much excess skin, loose abdominal muscles and subcutaneous fat you have in the abdominal area.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5402" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-5c2b43db30d37388c501e254aa351542">

</div><p>One thing to keep in mind is that we are 3 dimensional and you should always consider addressing the flanks and back area. Your board certified plastic surgeon will guide you in making the appropriate decision. (Kenneth Bermudez, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Abdominal liposuction addresses the fat accumulating on the anterior abdominal wall. An abdominoplasty removes the fat and skin through an incision and tightens the muscle. (Raffy Karamanoukian, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Not at all the same, though liposuction is often used during a tummy tuck. If you have loose skin and or loose muscles, you probably need more than liposuction. (Mario Loomis, MD, Middletown Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A tummy tuck and liposuction are not the same. A tummy tuck removes excess skin and fat from below the navel. It also flattens the abdomen by tightening the muscles. A liposuction is removal of fat only. (Howard T. Bellin, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5403" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p><strong>Liposuction and tummy tuck are not the same</strong></p><p>Liposuction is done to remove local collections of fat in areas which are exercise and diet resistant. It is done through very small incisions and thin cannulas are used to vacuum out the fat.</p><p>Results depend on good skin elasticity so the skin will “snap back” and recontour itself. A tummy tuck is a more extensive surgery in which skin and fat of the abdomen are surgically removed in order to tighten the skin of the abdomen and if needed the muscles to create a flatter, smoother abdomen.</p><p>I frequently perform liposuction at the same time as a tummy tuck, especially around the sides, to improve the contour of the waist. This is a safe and effective way to improve both the abdomen and waist. (Jeffrey M. Darrow, MD, Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5404" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d8ace6a67b21721f2ef7d633adea7cca">

</div><p>Liposuction removes excess fat and then your skin must shrink in order to tighten. It does NOT firm up a loose abdominal wall musculature. Tummy tucks remove excess skin and tighten the abdominal wall.</p><p>Tummy tucks are frequently performed along with liposuction of the hips. (Richard H. Fryer, MD, Salt Lake City Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Although many plastic surgeons combine some liposuction during the abdominoplasty procedure, this is often limited to the flank regions and/or thighs. The abdominoplasty procedure is used to address several components of the anterior abdominal region which liposuction does not.</p><p>The abdominoplasty – 1) Removes excess skin, 2) Removes excess fat, and 3) Tightens loose abdominal muscles (rectus muscles). Liposuction only removes excess fat. Therefore, liposuction relies on skin elasticity to contract once the excess fat is removed.</p><p>Although, there are some new types of liposuction techniques (i.e. laser-assisted) which have some component of skin tightening, it is often a modest amount and does not compare to the significant amount of skin that can be removed and tightened with abdominoplasty.</p><p>Your board-certified plastic surgeon will be able to deternine which type of procedure will be the most appropriate for your specific concerns. (Peter Ashjian, MD, Glendale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Abdominal Liposuction is simple liposuction of the abdomen (tummy). Tummy tuck is a surgical procedure that involves tighten of the abdominal muscles and removal of excess of skin. (Jaime Perez, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction is intended to only remove fat from an area. Liposuction can be performed in many areas including the abdomen. Liposuction depends on good skin elasticity as the skin has to readjust to a new shape.</p><p>A tummy tuck involves removal of fat and skin. It is a much more extensive procedure and is a good procedure if skin elasticity is poor. Abdominal liposuction can often be combined with a tummy tuck to help improve definition and contour of the abdomen.</p><p>In our Plano practice, we often combine the two procedures to give the best result for each individual patient. (Naveen Setty, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction is a procedure to sculpture the locked fat areas of your body & can be done on abdomen with or without tummy tuck. Abdominoplasty or tummy tuck is a procedure which tightens the abdominal skin by redraping it & relocating the navel. (Anup Dhir, MD, India Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Abdominal liposuction sucks out fat only. It does not remove excess skin, nor does it tighten abdominal muscles. Liposuction is ideal for someone with a small belly pouch or love handles who doesn’t have a lot of extra skin and who doesn’t need muscle tightening.</p><p>After liposuction the skin will remain and may be loose. Only direct removal of the skin (via a tummy tuck) can address that problem. If you do not undergo a tummy tuck you will be left with loose wrinkled skin.</p><p>For some patients this may be sufficient as they want to look good in clothes and don’t care about what they look like in a bikini/swim suit (or at least they are more terrified of having a surgery than looking bad naked). (Martin Jugenburg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction is a method to remove fat via a small cannula. A tummy tuck is a procedure that remove fat and loose skin. It is performed to remove loose abdominal tissue typically after weight loss or preganncy. (Siamak Agha, MD, PhD, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Liposuction of the abdomen and a tummy tuck are worlds apart!</em></p><p>Liposuction is a physiologically easy procedure often done with local or local and sedation. Patients have an easy convalescence. The procedure only removes fat which means that if excess skin is the problem or laxity of the abdominal wall is part of the problem, the procedure (as simple as it is) won’t work.</p><p>Abdominoplasty is considerably more involved, involves more risk, more convalescence, and a generous incision. It is designed to address excess skin, fat , and tighten the abdominal wall. (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction is intended to remove or reduce fat deposits. The Tummy Tuck (abdominoplasty) procedure is intended to remove or reduce loose skin. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There are 4 main issues that need to be addressed and examined when a women comes in and consults for abdominal contouring- muscle/fascia, subcutaneous fat, intraabdominal fat, and excess skin. The truth is, most women who have given birth, have some or all of theses issues at varying degress of severity.</p><p>This is why it is crucial for a proper examination to be performed so that the optimal result is obtained. Almost everyone benefits from tightening the fascia to flatten the posture. The fat and skin are then redraped over the new contour.</p><p>If there is excess fat, it is thinned with liposuction. If there is excess skin it is removed. Mild amounts of excess skin allow for a mini-tummy tuck where the belly button is left undisturbed.</p><p>Greater amounts of excess skin will need a full tummy tuck to get the best result. Traditionally, we have been taught that liposuction should not be done at the same time as a tummy tuck, but some of us know that it can be done safely and give spectacular results.</p><p>Why would you spend all of the time tightening the fascia and then leave a blanket of skin and fat to cover your wonderful work? In summary, think about what it is that bothers you about your tummy- if its loose skin and you want it tighter, a liposuction only will not make you happy. (Sam M. Sukkar, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction and a tummy tuck are two different procedures. Liposuction surgery removes fat from the targeted area through a small skin opening. Tummy tuck is a more advanced surgical procedure, involving much larger skin incision, it also addressed associated skin and muscle issues.</p><p>On occasion liposuction is performed at the same time as a tummy tuck. A skilled and experienced surgeon will be able to discuss your individual anatomy and advise as to the best surgical option for you. (Boris M. Ackerman, MD, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
