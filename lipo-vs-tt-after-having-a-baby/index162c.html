Its ideal as a standalone procedure when the fat pockets are covered by good elastic skin.</p><p>A tummy tuck on the other hand address the loose, redundant skin (with /without stretch marks) over the lower abdomen, following a pregnancy or massive weight loss.</p><p>The tummy tucks also address any weakness in the abdominal muscle wall (divarication of recti) which are tightened during the procedure.</p><p>Therefore, in a patient, if loose skin or muscle are an issue, they are a candidate for a tummy tuck.</p><p>A simple standalone liposuction procedure will not serve any purpose.

</div><p>It is a great adjunctive tool to address other areas, such as the flanks, hips, thighs along with the abdomen, to achieve more “complete” body contouring. (Sameer Karkhanis, MS, DNB, India Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Many men and women are confused regarding the indications for a tummy tuck versus liposuction. Liposuction will only address the fat between the skin and the muscle, whereas, a tummy tuck addresses excess skin, fat and laxity of the muscle layer.</p><p>The two most common indications for a tummy tuck are men and women who have lost a significant amount of weight and have loose skin in their mid-sections; and women who have lost their shape following pregnancy. (Rodger Wade Pielet, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tummy tuck surgery involves 2 main components:</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_261" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

<li>Excising the excess skin typically from the level of the umbilicus to the suprapubic region (often in an elliptical fashion)</li>
<li>Tightening of the abdominal wall fascia from xiphoid to the suprapubic region.</li>
</ul><p>Consider the typical case of a woman after several pregnancies. During pregnancy, to accommodate the baby, the skin, as well as the underlying fascial structure (often mislabeled as muscle), stretches. Unfortunately, after delivery, not all of the skin retracts to the pre-pregnancy state, and neither does the underlying fascia.</p><p>Obviously, there are various degrees of postpartem residual changes. A similar situation may arise from significant weight loss as well. In the cases above, a tummy tuck surgery would address both components involved – i.e. excess skin and loose/lax underlying fascia. In contrast, liposuction involves removal of fat underneath the skin.</p><p>It does not address the skin nor the underlying fascia. In fact, at times, liposuction may cause the skin to become more loose, as fat is removed (which essentially acted to support/fill the skin).</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_262" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-aec967d40d356933126649b0e03750ff">

</div><p><em>So it comes down to identifying which of the 3 components are in need of correction:</em></p><ol>
<li>If it’s skin or the muscle – tummy tuck surgery.</li>
<li>If it’s mainly fat – liposuction.</li>
<li>If it’s both – then it depends on your priority: which bothers you more? The loose skin of the lower abdomen or the fat?</li>
</ol><p>Although it is tempting to say both and request both tummy tuck surgery AND liposuction at the same time, this would compromise the blood supply to the remaining skin and increases the risk of complications (ask your surgeon about this).</p><p>Contouring of the flanks and hip regions is possible, but significant liposuctioning of the central abdomen in conjunction with a full tummy tuck surgery is often not recommended.</p><p>As a last possibility, one could consider a mini-tummy tuck (involving excising only part of the excess skin – thereby leaving you with some residual skin excess) with liposuction.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_263" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Because a “mini” tummy tuck is being performed, a more aggressive liposuction can be done without compromising the blood supply to the abdominal skin. All in all, the right choice depends on identifying the components (skin, fascia, fat), your priority (what bothers you the most), and your understanding of the various options and their limitations (as well as potential complications/risks).</p><p>Of course, any of the surgical options would require you to be in a good physiologic condition and with minimal risk factors (e.g. smoking – which significantly increases the risk of complications – to a point where many surgeons would not perform tummy tuck surgeries if smoking cannot be stopped perioperatively). (Christopher Chung, MD, Corona Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Liposuction or Lipo Abdominoplasty </b></p><p>While liposuction can be highly effective it has distinct limitations when it comes to your abdomen Liposuction alone cannot do the following:</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_264" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</ol><p>A modern Lipo Abdominoplasty procedure, which combines a Tummy Tuck and Liposuction, address all of the above issues in a manner that Liposuction alone simply cannot.</p><p>A well performed Lipo Abdominoplasty procedure can provide truly dramatic and exceptional results. Over the years I have been referred many patients who remained unsatisfied with the looseness of their skin following their abdominal liposuction and now desired a Tummy Tuck correction. (Marvin F.

</div><p>Liposuction involves insertion of a long cannula with removal of excess fat in areas accomplishing a thinning of fat, while a tummy tuck procedure involves removal of all the excess skin that is left within the lower abdomen and tightening of the abdominal musculature back to its appropriate form.</p><p>In the end, our goal is always patient dependent, and depends on the patient’s anatomy and what is ultimately best. A consultation with a board certified plastic surgeon would allow you the right information to help guide you along in which pathway to take.

</div><p>On the other hand an abdominoplasty can address multiple issues that patients frequently have and it is used in combination with liposuction. You have the capacity of removing excess fat in problem areas, remove the excess skin and tighten the abdominal wall.</p><p>Women often choose liposuction over tummy tuck just for the fact that it is easier for them but many times they are not good candidates just for that. Most times women who want the pre baby look need to have a mommy makeover and that incorporates a tummy tuck. (Mel T. Ortega, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>The goal in liposuction is to remove fat from the abdomen.</h3><p>A tummy tuck or an abdominoplasty also removes excess skin. Usually women who have had kids are best suited for a combination of liposuction and abdominoplasty.</p><p>Women who have not had kids and find their abdominal area has a persistent pocket of fat are ideal candidates for liposuction of the abdomen.

</div><h5>The difference between Liposuction and a Tummy Tuck</h5><p>Liposuction and Tummy Tuck are two excellent procedures to help contour the body, however, the two procedures are very different. Liposuction is procedure which directly removes fat from the desired site by using a canula to suction the fat.</p><p>As healing takes place, the skin can contract, leaving a nicely contoured body area. It can be used on the thighs, hips, stomach, flanks, arms, back, and neck with great results. A Tummy Tuck is a procedure used to remove excess skin and tighten the abdominal muscles, usually following weight loss or child birth.</p><p>The procedure involves undergoing a bigger surgery, with a longer recovery than liposuction. However, when everything is healed, the result will leave you with a slender, rejuvenated look. (Shain A. Cuber, MD, Edison Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_268" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><h4>Tummy tuck tightens, Liposuction Lessens</h4><p>Tummy tuck, also known as abdominoplasty, is one of my favorite surgeries because the results are so much more impressive than anyone can imagine. The skin is tout and the belly is flat again. Women actually do wear a 2 piece bikini even if they did not prior to kids!</p><p>Resection of all the fat & skin from the belly button down to, and including some of the hair bearing skin of the pubis is combined with tightening of the muscle in the midline to create a completely flat abdomen.</p><p>Many thin people do not have much fat but the looseness of the skin is bothersome, especially when sitting, as the upper abdomen wrinkles over and the lower belly bulges out. Other women have a large roll that developed when they were young or with the pregnancy.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_269" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>What ever the cause, the results are just wonderful. The scars are typically hidden in the bikini line and around the belly button. Rarely is a vertical scar necessary. If a vertical scar is present prior to surgery, it will be utilized to reduce the posterior fullness as well.</p><p>Stretch marks look better when the skin is pulled tight. Liposuction is an excellent procedure for a person with nice smooth skin, minimal wrinkling but too much fullness.</p><p>We have been using the Smart Lipo in the office which has marked improvement in the skin tightening due to the initial internal laser treatment followed by the traditional liposuction.</p><p>The results of the smart lipo is excellent in most places including the abdomen if the skin quality is good and has adequate elasticity for the skin to contract once the fat is removed. Evaluation in person is very helpful to determine which are the best options to achieve the desired result.

</div><p>When evaluating the abdomen one has to take into consideration the amount of skin laxity, the subcutaneous fat, the muscle layer and then the visceral fat (within the abdomen around the internal organs). Liposuction is a great alternative for someone with little to no skin laxity and and intact muscular wall.</p><p>However, often after childbearing years, in addition to subcutaneous fat, the muscle wall is lax and there’s excess skin. Liposuction under these circumstances would not be advised. An abdominoplasty would tighten not only the skin but also the underlying muscle wall and reduce the subcutaneous fat in between. (Leo McCafferty, MD, Pittsburgh Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction is a technique used to remove excess fat from under the skin with suction, by making a tiny incision, using a small instrument called a cannula. Abdominoplasty, or tummy tuck, is used to make the abdomen firmer.</p><p>The surgery involves the removal of loose and excess skin and fat from the abdomen as well as tightens the muscles of the abdominal wall. this type of surgery is usually sought by patients with loose or sagging tissues after pregnency, like yourself, or major weight loss.</p><p>That being said, a doctor would need to assess you first and foremost to see which are the areas of excess fat and how elastic your skin is. The more localized the area is and the more elastic the skin, the better the result. (Teanoosh Zadeh, MD, FRCSC, Montreal Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Tummy Tuck and Liposuction</i></p><p>Every doctor will have a different opinion on which of these procedures to do first. Truly, it depends on the patient and the outcome goals of the individual. In general, I prefer to do the tummy tuck first and the liposuction after.</p><p>Sometimes the tummy tuck takes care of the problem that concerns the patient. If post tummy tuck contouring is still desired after the initial surgery, liposuction can address problem areas. Usually the patient will opt to have sculpting in another area at the same time.</p><p>Since I price liposuction by the estimated OR time, this makes more sense for my patients than having liposuction first and the tummy tuck after. Occasionally, I will recommend liposuction as a first round less invasive alternative, but for most of my patients this will not achieve the desired results.
