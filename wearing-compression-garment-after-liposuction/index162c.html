<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Post-lipo garment is a critical part of the healing process. In our practice, we place liposuction patients in their garment in the OR before they are brought to recovery.</p><p>Underneath the garment, we apply reston foam to help with compression even further. Our patients are instructed to stay in this dressing for 4 days. During this time, we ask that they sponge bath only and do not remove the garment.</p><p>The reasoning behind this is to prevent seroma (fluid pocket) formation, assist with swelling, and improve the contour of their results. After day 4, they can remove the garment and foam to shower and can then begin washing their garment.</p><p>For the first 4 weeks after their surgery, we ask patients to wear their garment “full time” (all day, with the exception of showers and washing the garment).</p><p>They can then wear the garment “part time” (12 hours a day, during the day under clothes or at night while sleeping) for 2 additional weeks.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2063" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-849942ca5aaf2a7baa072b5eb4901d89">

</div><p>After 6 weeks, they no longer require the garment, though many patients choose to wear it a while longer as they grow accustomed to it’s support. While opinions differ on the recommendations regarding garments, we have seen optimal results with what we recommend to our patients. (Nana N. Mizuguchi, MD, FACS, Louisville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>For the most part, recovery from liposuction is easily manageable. Since clothing can conceal areas that have been sculpted, most patients are back at work after just a couple of days. During your first week, you’ll need to wear a tight-fitting elastic compression garment to help the skin adhere to the underlying muscle and remaining fat, and also the keepthings from shifting around.</p><p>In short, this garment helps to define your newbody shape. (Some patients say it feels like wearing a girdle or a wet suit.)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2064" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The garment also helps to prevent fluid from collecting under the skin,compressed the incisions together, and reduces swelling.</p><p>Generally at one week I have my patients remove the garment to shower, though you’ll likely have towear it an additional week. However, it’s best to check with your surgeon. You may decide you want to even if not required: After a few days it becomes something of a security blanket, and some patients find they never want to takeit off. (Michelle Copeland, MD, DMD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I advise my patients to wear compression 24 / 7 for one month. After that, about 30-40% of them ask “permission” to go a couple of weeks longer because they like the feel and sense more security. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2065" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Liposuction requires compression to help reduce the swelling, It would help with the contouring. I have my patients were for 4 to 6 weeks for better results. (Orlando Llorente, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Compression Garment after Liposuction </b></p><p>I recommend my patients to wear a compression garment everyday for at least 6 weeks after surgery to reduce swelling and improve the final result. But to make sure that the garment is not too tight because it could interrupt blood flow venus return (Jaime Perez, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>I don’t use compression garments on most patients.</h4><p>They don’t do any harm, but they are uncomfortable and do not improve the final result. You will look better at 1 week with a garment, but at three months there is no difference. Other plastic surgeons in New York who do a lot of liposuction have come to the same conclusion. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2066" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><b>How long to wear a compression garment?</b></p><p>Wearing a proper compression garment can really help to support the tissues and reduce swelling following surgery. For my patients, I recommend wearing the compression garment all day except for showers for the first month following surgery.</p><p>After this time I have them switch to wearing the garment at night for another 3 months and wear a light compression garment such as Spanx during the day for this time. Every surgeon has different recommendations and you should follow the specific instructions that your doctor laid out for you. (Michael L. Workman, MD, Portland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Compression Garment usage following Liposuction</b></p><p>I typically will provide two compression garments for my patients as part of their post-operative kit. I recommend that the garment be worn 24 hours a day 7 days a week only removing to shower for the first 2 weeks and then 12 hours a day for the next two weeks.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2067" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-326e6279312e456c66f14329a9eb3680">

</div><p>Some patients do like to wear their garments longer, especially if they are more active. This is perfectly fine for them to do although it is not something that is a must with regard to recovery.</p><p>I always discuss with my patients that liposuction is a game of patience, the more active you are post-operative the longer the swelling may linger. I typically do not take post-operative photos until 3 months following surgery and will always discuss that it could take up to 6 months to see the final result. (Patrick Viscardi, MD, South Bend Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I advise my patients to wear a compression garment day and night for the first 6 weeks post op. The compression garment helps to control the swelling and provide support. (Eddy Dona, MBBS, FRACS, Sydney Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Garments after liposuction</strong></p><p>I recommend patients wear compression garments for 1-3 weeks following liposuction. It is most important during the first week. (David Stoker, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Patients are usually instructed to wear elastic compression garments after the surgery, the period of time will be advised by the doctor. (Jed H. Horowitz, MD, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I don’t know of any study that has compared results after liposuction evaluating the time of compression. I generally recommend two weeks full time and weeks 3 through 6 either daytime or at night. Many of my colleagues have similar protocols. (Ronald Shelton, MD, Manhattan Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Different surgeons have different protocols which they find work for them and their patients. I have my patients wear compression garments day and night for 3 weeks after the surgery, and “as much as possible” after that. For this reason, many patients opt for liposuction in the winter months. (Damian Marucci, MBBS, PhD, FRACS, Sydney Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2069" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-c2f5aca0ae8039d95636746569013143">

</div><p><strong>How long to wear compression garments post liposuction</strong></p><p>Typical recommendations are to wear them 24 hours, 7 days a week for 6 months post liposuction – you can obviously remove them while taking a shower and so on.</p><p>Considering the fact that compression garments are not the most comfortable things to wear for most patients, 6 months & 24/7 might sound a lot. But having performed over 1400 liposuction surgeries, I can tell you that if your final results are important to you, then compression garments are perhaps as important a part of liposuction as the surgery itself. (Jayanthy Ravindran, MS, DNB, MRCS, India Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Length of time with compression garment</b></p><p>I typically recommend my patients continue to wear their post-op compression garments for 3 months post-op, as much as possible, day and night. Anything beyond this is likely not providing any additional benefit. (Joshua D. Zuckerman, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2070" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><strong>Time to wear compression</strong></p><p>I tell my patients that they will probably want to wear compression for 2-3 weeks. I believe the compression helps with comfort after surgery. I do not believe it changes the end result, although compression can help to control swelling which may help you see your end result a little sooner.</p><p>I tell patients that they can stop wearing compression when the discomfort from wearing the garments exceeds the comfort the get from wearing them. (Samir S. Rao, MD, Chevy Chase Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Compression garments and swelling.</h3><p>The management of swelling after liposuction surgery is often a topic that is overlooked by surgeons and patients alike. We focus on what is seen externally when we should really be asking about when the lymphatic vessels completely recover, in my opinion.</p><p>In fact, it is when the lymphatic system has completely recovered that swelling is fully resolved. Recovery varies from patient to patient so randomly assigning a time like 6 or 8 weeks is not appropriate for all patients.</p><p></p>

</div>Some patients simply recover more slowly than others. The skin contraction and shrinkage of the body takes approximately 6-9 months to occur. Meaning, I would not expect a final outcome for 9 to 12 months. 
<p>The initial compression garment can be worn for the first 6 weeks to assist in the skin contraction such that the best possible contour is achieved.</p><p>I find that the majority of my patients are not fully healed in the lymphatic system at 6 weeks and need to wear the garments longer. I actually suggest 3-6 months for best results. </p><p>I base my recommendation for length of garment wearing or not the physical examination at 3 and 6 months still demonstrates swelling. (Aldo Guerra, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Generally for my patients you will be wearing the compression garments 24/7 for two weeks. Garments are not perfect and can ride up and leave an error of the garment fitting. I monitor my patients closely and will often suggest alternative clothing that I really like for the tight fit without too much constraint after the initial two week period.
