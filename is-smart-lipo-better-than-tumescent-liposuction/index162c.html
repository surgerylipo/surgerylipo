Treatment should be individualized based on the patient. Tissue tightening can be achieved by only liposuction alone.</p><p>Areas where skin is loose, such as the neck, abdomen, or arms, sometimes benefit from dual treatment of liposuction + one of these other technologies. (Melanie D. Palm, MD – Account Suspended, San Diego Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>There are many forms of liposuction and techniques, the most common being tumescent liposuction. </p><p>In tumescent liposuction a solution is placed in to the fatty layer to expand and allow easier removal of fat directly by suctioning.</p><p>The techniques is very versatile and can be applied to large or small areas. Smart lipo is a newer form of laser assisted liposuction in which laser energy and heat is used to injure the fat cells and contour an area.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3840" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>The jury is still out on the laser assisted techniques though some surgeons find them useful. </p><p>The best advice is to search for the smartest surgeon rather than the newest technique. (Peter E. Johnson, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Which type of Liposuction is BEST?</strong></p><p>There are many different forms of liposuction. The ‘original’ liposuction, laser, ultrasound, water-assisted etc… there are many different variations but ultimately none has been shown in randomized trials to be superior to the original, simple liposuction.</p><p>The benefit of the new types in not in a better outcome, but in the fact that they break up fat and make it a little easier on the surgeon. But in the end, the cosmetic outcome is no different.

</div><p>Tumescent liposuction is an extremely popular and effective technique for body contouring. Smart Lipo uses a cannula that is slightly smaller and is best for treating small areas of fat deposit. If you wish to treat a large area of fat such as the abdomen, the flanks, the waist, or thighs or tumescent liposuction will treat these areas effectively and more quickly than Smart Lipo. (Pat Pazmino, MD, FACS, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>If you classify liposuctions on the techniques based on fluids instillation than the term tumescence applies. This category is divided into DRY vs WET. The DRY Method is no tumescent fluids injected, out of use today.</p><p>The WET method is subdivided into Half Wet, Wet, and Super Wet (mostly used by plastic surgeons). Now the types of liposuctions are as follows: SAL, Ultra Sonic, Vaser, PAL, Laser Lipolysis (Smart Lipo, Slim Lipo, Pro Lipo, Lipo Lite, etc.), WAL or Body Jet Lipo. Each are methods of removing, destroying the fats. (Darryl J. Blinski, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Tumescent liposuction versus Smart Lipo</em></p><p>All liposuction is essentially a blind procedure in that you don’t see exactly what the cannula is doing. Therefore you want to be as careful and limited as you can. Smart lipo has an element of unpredictability in that it emits a blast of energy from the tip, and you don’t know how much fat it melts, how much fat it damages but leaves behind, and how the skin is going to react to the heat emmitted by the smart lipo. (Ricardo L. Rodriguez, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Tumescent refers to the type of local anesthesia used in the liposuction procedure and not the type of liposuction itself. The tumescent solution consists of Lidocaine with epinephrine diluted in a liter of Normal Saline or Ringer’s Lactate solution.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3843" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>This solution is infiltrated into the fatty tissue until it expands; thus the term “tumescent”. Usually 20-30 minutes is allowed for the solution to provide excellent analgesia and constrict the small blood vessels. After the tumescent solution has been infiltrated traditional liposuction can be performed with small diameter cannulas.</p><p>Recent advances in the use of laser to assist this process has resulted in significant advantages. Smart Lipo with its 1064 and 1320 wavelength has the advantage of tightening the skin, less bruising and swelling in the post operative period than traditional liposuction.</p><p>It is an excellent choice if there is any question about skin laxity. I prefer the newest laser assited modality, Slim lipo, because the laser specifically melts fat with its 924 wavelength and also results in skin tightening.</p><p>As with Smart lipo there is significant skin tightening and much less bruising , swelling and less discomfort post op than we see with traditional liposuction. (Joel B. Singer, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Both are good if performed by the right individual, but that is a tough thing to know going into it</h5><p>I use only tumescent liposuction in my practice and perform SmartLipo as well. Unfortunately, most people doing SmartLipo these days don’t know or care about the tumescent method, so the quick recovery, bloodless procedure and painless surgery aren’t going to happen.</p><p>Go to a surgeon who does this procedure the right way! (Joel Schlessinger, MD, Omaha Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Smart lipo can hurt you. Tumescent liposuction is safer and better</h3><p>Certainly tumescent liposuvtion is the preferred way to go. Smart lipo is just a clever name that was assumed and trademarked. It and does not actually mean what it claims. Lasers do burn under surface of skin and cause variable and sometimes irreversible harm.</p><p>Do not be carried away by name. Be smart. Have tumescent liposuction. (Vasdev Rai, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Tumescent Technique Liposuction – This technique revolutionized liposuction by reducing blood loss and making liposuction a safe outpatient procedure. Although newer versions using lasers and ultrasound now exist, traditional tumescent technique liposuction still offers the best combination of safety and effectiveness. (David L. Mobley, MD, FACS, Sarasota Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Modern liposuction involves use of tumescent technique. A simplified explanation of tumescent technique is that the tissue is infiltrated with fluid that causes the blood vessels to constrict and makes the fat easier to remove.</p><p>SmartLipo is a trademark, just as is SlimLipo, Vaser, etc. I would recommend not getting caught up in the marketing and focus on the surgeon performing your procedure. Ask to see before and after photos.</p><p>The skill of your surgeon should be the most important factor in choosing a procedure. Buying the latest Air Jordan sneakers doesn’t mean you can play basketball like Michael Jordan… (Ralph Trey Aquadro, MD, Auburn Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>the term tumescent liposuction has been commonly misunderstood by patients & has been amply clarified now on this forum. It is a prelude to any liposuction technique (SAL,PAL,VAL Vibro lipo) where in fluid with local anaesthesia & adrenaline is injected into the fat for haemostasis before sucking it out.</p><p>As far as Smart lipo is concerned it has severe limitations, its meant to address small areas & is no match for the versatality of the other techniques. Finally, it is the surgeon that matters when it comes to achieving good results, not so much the “latest” fancy gadget in his hands. (Sameer Karkhanis, MS, DNB, India Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There are so many fancy names for liposuction now that even surgeons can hardly keep up! The bottom line is that they are all very similar and what you are hearing and reading about are different “Brand Names” for the devices.</p><p></p>

</div>The only thing that matters is the experience and capability of your surgeon. The word “tumescent” just means that we inject fluid into the fat first. This fluid makes it easier to break up the fat and it also contains anesthetic that makes the patient wake up with less discomfort.
<p>We break up the fat with either sound waves (ultrasonic) or light waves (laser). Both work equally well. The other thing that matters is how the surgeon “smooths out” the contour. This is done by using different sizes of cannulas and suctioning in different directions.</p><p>So when you hear terms such as “Cool lipo”, “Slim lipo, and “Smart lipo” be aware that these are just marketing terms and are of no significance in deciding what surgeon to choose. (Diana L. Elias, MD, Saint Petersburg Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Tumescent is infiltrating fluid in the fatty area of concern until the tissue is rigid, and then the procedure of liposuction occurs, whether a laser is used first, a Vaser, etc. The Smart lipo procedure has to instill fluid into the area as well, prior to use of the laser.</p><p>The Tumescent name is often not well understood. All lipo for the most part uses some form of Tumescent liposuction, even if it is super wet, just short of the tumescent end point. (Vivek Bansal, MD, Danville Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
