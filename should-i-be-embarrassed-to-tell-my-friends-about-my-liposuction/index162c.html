<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>The only reason I can think of that you might be self-conscious about your liposuction procedure is if you experience a poor outcome as a result of making poor decisions, like letting your eye doctor do liposuction on you in his office…As long as you have your procedure performed for appropriate motivations by a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon in a certified facility and with responsible anesthesia and attention to surgical technique (a given if you use a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon), you can reasonably expect an outcome that you can be proud of and that your friends will admire.</p><p>One of the benefits of seeing a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon for these types of procedures is the training and experience we have in managing the problems that can occur (although they are infrequent) after liposuction.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6994" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b8fde550580d16b61feba6240a055a2c">

</div><p>Trust your body and your safety to a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon- and be proud of your outcome! (Armando Soto, MD, FACS, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Keep your decision to have liposuction personal</h5><p>If you are concerned with how your friends would react to you having had cosmetic surgery, don’t tell them. Fortunately, liposuction is one of those procedures that can be done without many people knowing. This is because you can hide the postop garment under your clothes.</p><p>Postop pain is tolerable and you should be able to return to work within days. Choosing to have cosmetic surgery is a very personal decision, as is letting others know about it. Hopefully, this issue won’t prevent you from enjoying the benefits of liposuction surgery.

</div><p><em>Liposuction and Privacy</em></p><p>Liposuction is undergone by thousands of women in the US every year. Moreover, survey after survey has shown that Plastic Surgery, including Liposuction, is accepted and does not have the stigma is used to have.</p><p>I do not know your friends, but based on the thousands of patients and their friends I have met over the years, the ONLY emotion I have seen repeatedly among friends was mild jealousy that they were not the ones having the surgery and the nicer figure, breasts or face.</p><p>Odds are your friends will be supportive and feel the same way. If you disagree, don’t tell them. Eventually, they will break down and beg you to give them the name of your diet, gym or trainer… (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6996" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><em>There’s Nothing to be Embarassed About</em></p><p>Cosmetic surgery has had a negative stigma for many years. In the past it seemed like it was only acceptable for movie stars to have face lifts or other cosmetic procedures. This is changing rapidly.</p><p>Today there are many more well qualified plastic surgeons around the world and this means cosmetic procedures including liposuction are available to many more people. In addition, the vast array of media exposure from reality shows, news media, magazines etc.</p><p>has placed cosmetic surgery in the main stream and it has become much more acceptable in the perception of the general population. In may practice I find that there are some patients who are very private about their cosmetic surgery.</p><p>They share their cosmetic surgery experience with only the closest of friends. I also have many patients who are willing to tell anyone willing to listen that they have had one or several cosmetic procedures.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6997" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>I’ve had other patients say that when they revealed that they had plastic surgery, they were amazed at how many of their friends and acquaintances also admitted to having some “work” done. If you are self conscious about telling someone that you have had a cosmetic surgery procedure then don’t tell them.</p><p>If you know someone who would definitely ridicule you for having liposuction-don’t subject yourself to their comments. On the other hand, if you have some close friends who have had this type of surgery, or think they may be encouraging then you may say something to them.</p><p>You may be surprised how many positive and encouraging comments you get. (James H. Schmidt, MD (retired), Sarasota Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Liposuction is not embarassing</em></p><p>You would have no need to hide anything. You friends will just think you look great and you can tell them you went on a diet. (Howard T.

</div><p><i>It’s up to you to tell if you had Liposuction or not</i></p><p>I see a lot of patients who are a bit embarrassed to tell friends. Little do they realize that their friends have had procedures too. It is your choice to tell or not. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Chances are your friend has had liposuction</em></p><p>It is common for patients who have undergone cosmetic surgery to keep it confidential, even if it’s to their close friends. According to the ASPS, 245,000 people had liposuction by board certified plastic surgeons in 2016 (that’s not counting family practitioners, dermatologist and ob/gyn doctors that perform this procedure!).</p><p>Due to its safety record, minimal downtime and effectiveness, this procedure is extremely common.

</div><p><b>Keeping liposuction under wraps</b></p><p>You can probably stay discreet about your liposuction and recovery, but I bet some of your friends have had it, or feel the same way you do about getting it. It would probably be an enlightening discussion…someone just needs to be the one to break the ice. (Douglas J. Mackenzie, MD, Santa Barbara Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Unless you plan on treating your chin, lipo results are easy to conceal as you simply put on your clothes. We perform all procedures under local anesthesia, outpatient. Many patients return to work within a day or two.</p><p>We use combined modality, power assist tumescent plus laser lipo. (Edmond A. Zingaro, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>You’d be surprised how many people consider plastic surgery</i></p><p><amp-img class="size-medium wp-image-7000 amp-wp-unknown-size amp-wp-unknown-width amp-wp-unknown-height amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="../wp-content/uploads/2017/09/index.html" alt="Dr. Jimmy S. Firouz, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon - Abdomen Liposuction" width="600" height="400" layout="fixed"></amp-img></p><p>It’s completely understandable to want privacy regarding something as personal as plastic surgery. But I bet if you do talk with your closest confidant(s) “hypothetically” about liposuction, you might be surprised by their reactions.</p><p>Plastic surgery is more common than you might think, and it certainly doesn’t carry the same stigma that it did decades ago. I think this might be important for you to consider as well: you have not failed yourself if you choose to have liposuction done.</p><p>Now, I’m assuming you’ve done everything you can reasonably do to get close to your ideal body weight, and you’re wanting liposuction to treat a problem area. That’s what liposuction is all about: getting rid of problem areas.</p><p>You might look at it as just another tool to reach your goals, just as excercise and diet are also tools to reach your goals. (Carmen Kavali, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Cosmetic surgery has gaine more acceptance in our society. However it is something you do for your self. If you are not comfortable with it, then DO NOT DO IT. (Samir Shureih, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Most patients want anonymity</em></p><p>Liposuction can be easily hidden from your critics. Plastic surgery is a personal decision and most patients don’t want to advertise it. Makes it tough for we plastic surgeons to assemble galleries for prospective patients.</p><p>Liposuction is easily covered by clothes until the stigmata of the procedure has passed. Then you look great and need not offer anyone any explanations. (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Cosmetic procedures are personal</strong></p><p>The real reason to have a cosmetic procedure is because it matters to you. It can make a big difference in the way you look, but more importantly in the way you feel about yourself.</p><p>For most cosmetic procedures, it’s easy to hide the fact that you have had them performed except from a spouse/partner. If you are feeling embarrassed about having the procedure done, you might spend some time thinking about your motivations.</p><p>Are you considering the procedure because of how you feel about yourself, or because of how you believe others think of you? Whatever you conclusion, done go ahead with the procedure unless you can really feel comfortable with the idea of having it done. (Daniel Sherick, MD, Ann Arbor Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>There’s nothing wrong about improving yourself</strong></p><p>People just need to get over this. There are no negative stigmas regarding cosmetic treatments; there are just negative people. One should just focus on themselves and forget what others may say or think. Let’s face it: the reason people undergo cosmetic procedures is because there is something that concerns them and they want it improved.</p><p>What could possibly be wrong or negative with this?
