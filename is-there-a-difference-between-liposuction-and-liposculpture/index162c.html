<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Liposuction is the term generally used for any procedure that removes fat using a cannula (the metal instrument used to suction out the fat) and a vacuum device.</p><p>Liposculpture is often used interchangeably with Liposuction and refers to the removal of fat and contouring of the treated areas using a ‘liposuction’ technique.</p><p>The term Liposculpture is sometimes used to describe a Liposuction technique in which smaller cannulas are used to finely contour an area. Other surgeons, however, use the term Liposculpture to enhance the marketability of Liposuction.</p><p>The bottom line is that Liposculpture is Liposuction, it just depends on how the surgeon is defining the terms. (Louis DeLuca, MD, Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>“Liposculpture” is just a term for a more refined form of liposuction. Liposculpture is meant to reduce small areas of fatty bulges, whether it is the love handles, saddle bags, abdomen, etc. In essence, any form of liposuction is a form of liposculpture.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4910" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Some plastic surgeons will refer to liposculpture when directed at smaller areas. Liposculpture is the process and the tools to achieve this can be traditional liposuction, ultrasonic lipo, tumescent (which really just refers to the anesthetic technique), and laser assisted liposuction/liposculpture (as with SmartLipo, ProLipo, Cool Lipo, etc.).</p><p>You should seek out a plastic surgeon with experience in all forms of liposuction so he/she can evaluate your particular anatomic problme, discuss your goals and expectations, and then recommend what technique would be best for you. (Theodore Katz, MD, FACS, Philadelphia Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>“Liposculpture” like many terms in cosmetic surgery is a term that really doesn’t indicate anything different than “liposuction.” It was probably devised as a marketing hook to attract interest. If you were to look in a book used to instruct plastic surgeons, the term liposculpture would be considered synonymous with liposuction. (John P. Di Saia, MD, Orange Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4911" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Liposculpture is one of multiple terms thrown about to describe liposuction contouring. First there was Suction Assisted Lipoplasty (SAL) to differentiate it from OTHER earlier means of contouring fat. This terms was soon replaced by Liposuction and its only offspring are the UAL (Ultrasound assisted Lipoplasty) and PAL (Power assisted lipoplasty).</p><p>Then came the VASER and its trademarked term LIPOSELECTION. Now, the Plastic Surgery grazing fields are populated with multiple largely similar young liposuction animals, each bearing a different catchy name — all seemingly intended to “brand” that procedure as being radically different than its very similar older clones grazing near by.</p><p>Do not fall for it. See a trustworthy Plastic surgeon and you will likely get the results you want. (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4912" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The definition of liposculpture may depend on exactly who you ask. In our practice, we use the term liposuction when we want to describe the process where we remove amounts of fat to change the contour or shape of the body.</p><p>We use the term liposculpture to describe the smaller removals of fat that helped contour the overlying tissue and skin so that they can mimic the underlying muscles and framework. In our practice, many patients typically get both procedures to reduce the overall volume of fat and then to sculpt the remaining fat into an attractive appearance. (Pat Pazmino, MD, FACS, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Liposculpture? Liposuction? Help!</i></p><p>Terms like liposuction and liposculpture are used by different doctors to mean different things. If you look through answers you’ll see a few different explanations. Always be careful to get your answers during personal consultation and see a few surgeons certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery for different opinions.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4913" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>When I use the term liposuction it refers to all procedures that involve removing fat using a thin hollow cannula and a suction machine. Liposculpture, to me, is when liposuction is done and some of the fat is used as a graft to augment other areas.</p><p>This is done in the face, buttocks and breasts. In those cases there is sculturing being done more so than simply performing liposuction.</p><p>I do not use the term liposculpture to mean “refined liposuction” because I feel that every liposuction operation required great attention to detail.</p><p>And I’m not a fan of inventing new words to describe old procedures to make them sound more exciting. (Adam Rubinstein, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Liposculpture IS Liposuction</i></p><p>One of the things I do not like about my chosen specialty is the way that some providers try to gain the attention of patients by inventing cute new names for procedures. So, along these lines, Liposculpture = Liposuction, Mini-facelift = Lunchtime lift = quick lift, etc… Don’t be fooled. I personally am offended when I think someone is trying to aggressively sell me something by giving it a cute name.

</div><p><b>Liposculpture is refined liposcution in my practice</b></p><p>Liposculpture is liposuction. I use the term liposculpture to refer to a refined liposcution procedure using smaller cannulae to remove very small amounts of fat from fit, not overweight people to improve the contour of body areas.</p><p>When I am removing large amounts of fat from heavier individuals, I use the term liposuction.</p><p>Liposuction of the hiups or “saddlebags”–called steatopygia– can be a very effective and rewarding procedure. (Brooke R. Seckel, MD, FACS, Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposculpture is liposuction. It is a fancy marketing term. It emphasizes the fact that liposuction is used to “sculpt” your body, which is simply stating the obvious. (Parham Ganchi, PhD, MD, Wayne Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The names all mean the same thing– removing excess fat from areas that require it and contouring the area to create a nice, smooth, even result. It works very well for the saddle bags, a very common problem spot for many patients, and can help crate better balance in size and shape between the upper and lower body.

</div><p><strong>Liposculpture same thing as liposuction</strong></p><p>Liposculpture is a nice marketing term for liposuction, which implies that the tissues of the body are being “sculpted” to their desired form. The same technique of injecting fluid usually containing an anesthetic and epinephrine followed by suction is being performed, no matter what it is called.</p><p>Saddle bags can certainly be addressed with liposuction. The best candidates have localized areas of fat which have not responded to diet and exercise. Liposuction is not effective as a means of weight loss. (Nina S. Naidu, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Fancy name for liposuction</i></p><p>Liposuction, suction assisted lipectomy, lipoplasty, and liposculpture are all names for the same thing. Some just sound fancier and more elegant than others but there is no difference. (Richard P.

</div><p><em>Liposculputre = Liposuction</em></p><p>Liposuction and liposculpture are really the same thing. Liposculpture is just a fancy way of saying liposuction. Liposuction can be used to decrease bulk (remove fat) and also sculpture the body by shaping the fat under the overlying skin. (David Shafer, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>The differences between liposuction and liposculpture are …</h4><p>Liposuction is the removal of fat, period. We used the term in the late 1980’s and 90’s. As techniques improved fat removal became possible in an aesthetic manner that attempts to restore the natural musculoskeletal shape to the body.</p><p>Just as one shoe size does not fit all, one technique of body sculpting will not suit all patients. For that reason the term liposculpture has value and it is appropriate for patients to ask their cosmetic surgeon how sculpting will be performed for their individual needs. (Edward Lack, MD, Chicago Dermatologist)</p><p><b>What is LipoSculpture? (Liposuction)</b></p><p>LipoSculpture is just another term for liposuction but sometimes refers to a unique method called “VASER Hi Def LipoSculpture.” It conveys the idea that you can actually sculpt the body with minimal incisions. Liposuction is a procedure where fat is removed from under the skin through small incisions.</p><p>In my experience of over 20 years of liposuction I personally believe that the best option is VASER liposuction or VASER Hi Def LipoSculpture. This involves an ultrasonic wand that literally melts the fat with high intensity vibration and allows for easier smoother removal with less chance of bumps and wrinkles.</p><p>Liposuction is ideal for saddlebags. Consult a Board Certified plastic surgeon who is experienced in VASER liposuction or VASER Hi Def LipoSculpture to discuss your concerns.
