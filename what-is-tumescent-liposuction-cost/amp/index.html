<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>The cost of liposuction depends on the part of the body to be treated, how large an area is to be liposuctioned, the technique used and where the procedure is performed. The best results are obtained with the tumescent technique, the gold standard for liposuction.</p><p>This technique can be safely performed in the office without sedation or anesthesia. The fees for an office facility are lower than the facility fee for a hospital or surgery center. The cost of local anesthesia is lower than the cost of involving an anesthesiologist for sedation.</p><p>Recovery is also quicker after the tumescent technique leading to fewer days off work and less loss of income. Keeping all of these factors in mind, you’ll get a better value for the net cost, with the tumescent technique of liposuction.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5447" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-df427de03e6a63b36d5a3a614ab89371">

</div><p>The tumescent technique was invented by a dermatologic surgeon. Dermatologic surgeons performing liposuction as noted above are the leaders in the tumescent technique as an office procedure. I hope this helps in making your decision. (Renuka Diwan, MD, Cleveland Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Liposuction Cost in Hawaii</h4><p>Liposuction costs are usually determined by the size and number of areas involved; essentially based on how much time it will take. It’s generally not worth it to pay extra for gimmicks that claim to be ‘smarter’ or use lasers or ultrsound.</p><p>Traditional Tumescent techniques by an experienced Board Certified Plastic Surgeon will work best for most patients. Pain is usually minimal and while recovery time varies from a few days to a few weeks. (Kevin Dieffenbach, MD, Oahu Island Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5448" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>*Liposuction cost will vary widely across the country and depending on the surgeon’s years of experience, the type of surgeon, the areas involved and the technique utilized. The definition of an area can vary tremendously depending on the surgeon.</p><p>As a board certified plastic surgeon, I find that patients can be overwhelmed with the number of different techniques available for liposuction. In any liposuction procedure, regardless of technique, the goal is to remove unwanted fatty tissue.</p><p>The American Society of Plastic Surgeons have stated that Tumescent Liposuction is still the safest and most consistent technique of liposuction. Physicians price liposuction based on the number of areas treated. For example, in my practice, liposuction of the abdomen and flanks(love handles) costs between 4,000 and 4,500 dollars.</p><p>We offer a discount to patients who wish to combine multiple areas of liposuction during the same surgery.(Christopher J. Morea, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5449" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>The cost of liposuction varies tremendously with areas to be suctioned, amount to be suctioned from each area, and of course the time involved in performing the procedure. There are different ways to perform liposuction.</p><p>Most commonly, I use the tumescent technique along with either the traditional small cannulas and/or the MicroAire power assisted liposuction cannula system with a 3mm or 4mm cannula. This gives me good control in the superficial and the deep fatty layers and their subsequent sculpturing by removal of fat. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction costs vary widely depending upon the area or areas being treated,where the procedure is done (hospital vs. surgicenter vs. office setting), type of anesthesia being used, whether its traditional tumescent liposuction compared to SmartLipo, and what the local market commands.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5450" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-15f703de3983f123ee61ce5c9b664247">

</div><p>Touch-ups to treated areas that still have some unwanted fullness after at least 6 months should be offered for no additional surgical costs, though facility fees may be applied. It is better to find the board-certified plastic surgeon you are comfortable with who has extensive experience and can show lots of before and after photos than to shop strictly on price. (Scott A. Brenman, MD, FACS, Philadelphia Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of tumescent liposuction varies by geographic region as well as by surgeon. Liposuction of one area may run abound $3,500 to $5,000. Typically each additional area is less expensive. More important than cost is choice of doctor.</p><p>A board-certified plastic surgeon is well-trained to safely perform both liposuction as well as other procedures that may be better suited for patients with lose skin, such as a tummy tuck in patients wanting improvement of the abdomen.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5451" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-e24e597143b25244ff1b1a78a26ec2eb">

</div><p>A board-certified dermatologist is also trained to do liposuction. (Heather J. Furnas, MD, Santa Rosa Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of tumescent liposuction depends on the number of areas, how much time the procedure takes, whether additional energy assisted options do (e.g. Slimlipo, Vaser), and what type of anesthesia you use. Typically, the cost will start at several thousand, and can go over ten thousand depending on the number of areas.</p><p>While cost may be a factor, I would strongly encourage you to consider the qualifications of the surgeon as your number one criteria. (Young R. Cho, MD, PhD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Tumescent liposuction Costs in India, at the Centre where I practice is as follows. USD 1800 for Single area. Every Additional Area it Costs USD 750</p><p>The cost includes Surgeons fee / Anaesthetist fees / Operation room charges/ Follow ups<br>
The cost excludes Pre procedure Lab Investigations and Post Procedure Garments ( approx USD 300)<br>
For Clients we see from overseas the Visa/ Travel / stay are additional. (Sasikumar Muthu, MS MCh, India Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Tumescent liposuction costs are based on time in the operating room and areas desired. The more liposuction the more time it takes subsequently the costs will be higher. The range is from 5500 to $8,500 (Frank J. Ferraro, MD, Paramus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The price of tumescent liposuction has several variables including the quality of the surgeon, the city that you live in, the number of areas and the length of time of the surgery. If you live near Atlanta, you will be comparing prices for Atlanta surgeons.</p><p>When you decide to work with a plastic surgeon, you will avoid less experienced surgeons, but will probably pay a little bit more. Surgery on 2 areas that takes 2 hours will be less expensive than surgery on 4 areas that takes 3-1/2 hours.</p><p></p>

</div>It all makes sense when you consider the various factors. (Sheldon Lincenberg, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)
<p>It is difficult to estimate costs for tumescent liposuction without a consult. Prices range from 500 dollars to over 10000 dollars for multiple areas. Generally the more areas the bigger the discount. (Kurtis Martin, MD, Cincinnati Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Costs are really variable. Usually there will be an initial cost starting with one area. If you add more things, you add more cost. I charge less for additional areas. Some liposuction can be done under local anesthesia.</p><p>This eliminates the facility and anesthesia charges. However, you don’t get as much done when under local. Liposuction starts at $2500 and goes up from there. </p><p>There are also different types of liposuction. Just because it is newer doesn’t mean it is the right thing for you.</p><p>Look for a board certified plastic surgeon. Have a consult and ask your questions. If you aren’t comfortable with that surgeon get a second opinion. Be sure to follow your surgeon’s instructions. (Tracy E. McCall, MD, Milwaukee Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost for liposuction depends on the number of areas being treated, cost of facilities as well as potential anesthesia fees. Typically, most plastic surgeons will charge more for a single area and give progressive discounts for multiple area treatments.</p><p>What defines an anatomic area also varies somewhat from surgeon to surgeon. I’ve seen the trunk broken into as many as nine areas. A reasonable single-area treatment would be around $3,500. A full abdomen, which includes upper abdomen, lower abdomen, waist and hips, may cost $6500.</p><p>If a formal operating room is used, then expect to pay between $1,000-$3,000 for a facility fee. Anesthesiologists in our area charge between $300 to $400 per hour. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons requires major liposuction to be done in the fully accredited facility.</p><p>This is going to cost more than having the procedure done by a non-plastic surgeon who does more of a back-office procedure. Perhaps the most expensive form of liposuction is having liposuction done by an inexperienced, improperly trained or untalented provider.</p><p>Revision surgery can cost much more than the original procedure, and bad work can leave people disfigured for life. Think long and hard before choosing discounted procedures by people who don’t have proper qualifications. (Mats Hagstrom, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
