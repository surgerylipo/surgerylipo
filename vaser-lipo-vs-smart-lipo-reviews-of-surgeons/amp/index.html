(Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Both technologies are effective for melting fat. One is Ultrasound based and the other is Laser.

</div><p>Always remember that at the of the day the operator is what matters and their experience in doing a lot of cases with each technology. (Spero Theodorou, MD, New York Physician)</p><h4>Advantages of SmartLipo combined with Vaser – Why choose only one?</h4><p>For almost four years, I have been combining laser fat contouring (SmartLipo) with Vaser Ultrasonic Lipo-selection, and I appreciate the consistent results. I use the SmartLipo device (a small laser fiber just below the surface of the skin) to smooth the surface fat and to tighten the skin with the heat from the laser.</p><p>The Vaser Ultrasound does a thorough job of breaking up the dense fat, esp., the fibrous fat around the torso. By using each tool to its advantage, I believe the patient benefits with overall smoother results.

</div><p><strong>Vaser vs. Smartlipo vs. traditional liposuction</strong></p><p>Vaser, Smartlipo and traditional liposuction are all excellent techniques for body shaping, and I use all three techniques in my practice. The Vaser device uses ultrasound energy to break up fat prior to removal of the fat with traditional liposuction technique and the Smartlipo device does the same using laser energy.</p><p>Which is best for you should be determined by a Plastic Surgeon familiar with each device after examining you. The most important thing to remember, however, is that the person who does your procedure is the most important decision you make.</p><p>Choosing the right surgeon is far more important than the device used to perform your operation. (John K. Wakelin III, MD, FACS, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Smart lipo uses a fiberoptic laser to thermally emulsify fat and tighten skin, Vaser use ultrasonic energy. I have quite a bit of experience with both devices in both virgin liposuction patients and revision patients.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3092" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>I currently use the new Smart Lipo Triplex system with 3 specific laser wavelengths and like it for it’s precise feedback. In the past I also used Vaser on a number of virgin and revision lipo patients and quite honestly it was very similar.</p><p>One thing I did not care for with Vaser was the size of incision that was needed at the entry points and needing to insert a ring at the skin to protect it. It also reduced the ability to obtain the exact perfect angle of entry as many times I lay my cannulas flat on the skin as I sculpt to avoid ever touching the muscle or ever jabbing or disrespecting the skin.</p><p>The latter can greatly contribute to skin irregularities. But quite honestly, I don’t think that either laser or Vaser offers that much of an advantage over well done traditional lipo despite all the marketing hype.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3093" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>In fact I would have to say that pretty consistently the worst results I have seen from other surgeons in my revision work have come from Vaser or smart lipo. Not that they are bad tools, but the lesson is to not just trust the machine but trust the surgeon. (David Amron, MD, Beverly Hills Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Vaser Liposuction vs. Smart Liposuction </em></p><p>Liposuction is a blanket name for any procedure that surgical removes fat through suction. There are several different types of liposuction available. All types of liposuction work by first breaking up the fat cells, then sucking them out.</p><p>The main differences you’ll see between the types of liposuction are in how the fat is broken up, and the size of the cannula (tube) used to suck the fat cells out. Traditional liposuction relies on the physical strength of your surgeon to break up the fat.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3094" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>He/She will use physical force to move the cannula through the fat layer, breaking it apart. When you think about the force required to perform this procedure, the inherent risks of puncture to the muscles and organs below, and lack of precision in results are clear.</p><p>This type of liposuction has largely been abandoned by plastic surgeons. Power-assisted liposuction (PAL) uses a vibrating cannula to break apart the fat. There are several different types of cannula tip attachments that can be used to create precise results.</p><p>When Vaser or Smartlipo liposuction are performed, typically PAL is used during the suction portion of the procedure. Vaser and Smartlipo liposuction systems add energy-based heating to the liposuction procedure. Vaser uses ultrasound technology whereas Smartlipo uses up to 3 laser wavelengths.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3095" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>Both work by first melting the fat with high-powered energy, then suctioning it out. Because these systems can melt fat without damaging the surrounding tissues, the doctor is able to easily melt and remove every last ounce of fat.</p><p>For that reason, these technologies are ideal for creating a hyper-sculpted athletic look.

</div>I know surgeons who create tiny waists and etch in abs without using Vaser or Smartlipo. I also know surgeons who believe everything done with PAL can be done with Vaser or Smartlipo. It’s really about what tools that surgeon is comfortable with, and what results that surgeon typically and predictably creates.
<p>Pick a surgeon, not a technology. (Mitchell Chasin, MD, Livingston Physician)</p><h4>Vaser and SmartLipo differences</h4><p>Many surgeons do not have the knowledge or experience with much of the newer technology, and therefore may not be providing unbiased answers. The latest SmartLipo Triplex, which has been available only since November of 2009, utilizes three separate wavelengths; 1440 nm which liquefies fat (40 times more affinity to fat than other laser on the market ) by what is called the photo-acoustic effect (without heat ).</p><p>The second is 1320 nm which is primarily absorbed by water and is used to heat the dermal collagen for better skin tightening. The third wavelength is 1640 nm and is mostly for hemostasis ( to seal the blood vessels ) so there is minimal bleeding and bruising afterward.</p><p>Vaser is older technology ( 8 years old ) and utilizes ultrasonic energy to liquefy the fat before liposuction. It generates quite a bit of heat and can damage the skin if the surgeon is not careful. There have been several studies published which show significant skin-tightening when compared with traditional liposuction.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3097" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I am not aware of any studies showing similar results with Vaser Liposuction. The specific advantage of the SmartLipo Triplex is the ability to accurately heat the skin to a specific temperature in order to optimize the result.</p><p>No other device currently on the market has the temperature monitoring capability of the SmartLipo Triplex. Although Vaser Lipo generates heat, as with any other ultrasonic device, the biggest risk is overheating the tissue resulting in skin injury, discoloration and scarring.</p><p>There are other devices, like Body-Jet ( water assisted lipo ), that are excellent for treating larger volumes of fat. This device does not generate any heat but removes fat through pulsating streams of saline solution. The fat is removed with minimal bleeding and the fat cells can be used for transplantation to other areas since they are not damaged in the process of removal.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3098" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-420e61b21d3185c58217fe448ab2df66">

</div><p>Neither Vaser or Laser liposuction fat is suitable for transfer to other areas of the body, because the cells have been ruptured before removal. I have experience with all of these technologies, so I am speaking from my own experience.</p><p>The most important factor in your result will be your selection of a surgeon. Look for a board certified plastic surgeon with extensive experience in liposuction and knowledge of newer technology and devices. (Steven L. Ringler, MD, FACS, Grand Rapids Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Properly performed traditional liposuction in the hands of a skilled surgeon remains the gold standard. Many other technologies have been developed and have not been scientifically proven to be better. The advertising mantras about enhancing skin shrinkage etc. are just part of the hype used to “sell” these new techniques. Clever names like “Smartlipo” don’t mean they are better. Remember, if your skin lacks good elasticity and if you are too overweight, you will be disappointed with your result no matter what technique is employed. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3099" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h5>Vaser and Smartlipo are Different!</h5><p>Vaser uses sound waves to break up the fat. Smartlipo uses a tiny laser to vaporize fat and tighten skin. They have different uses so it is not that one is “better” than another. One may be better for YOU than the other but you will have to ask a doctor that does both which would work better on your body. (Daryl K. Hoffman, MD, San Jose Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Both work</strong></p><p>I personally have used Smartlipo for ten years in thousands of cases and can attest to its efficacy in tightening skin. But I can also attest especially to its safety. One surgeon talks about the risk of abdominal perforation with the laser, which is absurd both because the muscles and fascia present a virtually impregnable barrier, and because the lasers have an automatic shut-off whenever temperature reaches high enough to burn tissue.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3100" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-2e919f2fd429e57e6b696af7dc1bd7e4">

</div><p>Both procedures can produce burns in the wrong hands, but in experienced hands both are good procedures. So make sure the hands are experienced! And beware of doctors who conjecture or opine about methods with which they have no experience. (Robert W. Benson, MD, Hammond Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h5>Vaser vs Laser lipo</h5><p>I have both and still use both, but in general I use more vaser for larger volumes and smart lipo for specific finite areas. I see more skin retraction with smart lipo ,but it will not replace the need for a tummy tuck if you have a lot of extra skin and can give a worse result if that is attempted.</p><p>In the right patient, both give really excellent results. (W. John Bull, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Different Technologies for Different Patients</h3><p>VASERlipo and Smartlipo are tools to improve the outcome of liposuction. VASER uses ultrasound energy; Smartlipo uses a laser. VASER’s ultrasound energy breaks apart fat before removal for less trauma to the surrounding tissues. Smartlipo’s laser energy does the same, with the added bonus of some skin tightening, a nice benefit when it’s used on the abdomen, arms, legs and neck.</p><p>Both methods are effective, but they are used for slightly different reasons. The choice essentially comes down to the surgeon’s expertise and preferred technique. I recommend consulting with a few different liposuction surgeons for an opinion and explanation of their preferences before you move forward with your procedure. (Kevin M. Johnson, MD, FACS, Spokane General Surgeon)</p></div>
