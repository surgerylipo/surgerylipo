<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Arm fat surgery is gaining popularity every year. Consider, when it is worth doing liposuction of arm, the cost of this procedure and how to prepare for it.</p><h3>WHAT IS IT ?</h3><p>Liposuction is a surgical method of removing fat mass from different parts of the body and its further correction. It can be carried out in different ways using modern techniques. The frequency of arm fat surgery is slightly less than the number of operations on the chin or abdomen, however more and more women and men turn to the plastic surgeon with the desire to get rid of the fat layer on the shoulders and hands.</p><h3>Why the shoulders are a problem area?</h3><p>The shoulder area can have a large fat mass for the following reasons:</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2777" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

<li>Hereditary predisposition (physiological tendency) of the body to the deposition of fat is in the shoulder area.</li>
<li>Passive lifestyle.</li>
<li>Various violations and disruptions in the work of the hormonal system.</li>
<li>Taking certain medications can also contribute to the deposition of fat in certain areas of the body.</li>
</ul><h3>ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF THIS PROCEDURE</h3><h4>Advantages of liposuction are:</h4><p>Liposuction enables a person to acquire “new” forms and get rid of local fat deposits in different parts of the body (cheeks, chin, abdomen, arms and so on). This operation is considered the fastest way to remove fat. No diet or sport for a couple of hours will not give such a result. The operation will help a person get rid of complexes that could develop due to deficiencies in the boy. Also with her help you can become more confident. Thanks to the successful correction of the figure with this technique, you can change the size of clothes at least two sizes smaller.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2778" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>You can remove fat from several areas at once (with combined liposuction).<br>
The removed fat will not be restored, if to adhere to medical references.<br>
Most of these operations are successful, and patients are satisfied with the result.<br>
Thanks to modern methods doctors can minimize the painfulness of the procedure and facilitate the rehabilitation period.<br>
Within a year after liposuction, most patients already lose weight by several phounds themselves, so they do not need a re-operation. Excess weight can provoke heart disease, blood vessels, cause diabetes and many other dangerous pathologies, so liposuction will help reduce the risk of their development.</p><h4>The disadvantages of liposuction are:</h4><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2779" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>The high cost of the procedure makes it far from affordable for anyone who wants to lose weight in this way.<br>
High risk of development of dangerous complications (bleeding, hematoma).<br>
The operation has many contraindications, so not all people can do it because of their health condition.<br>
Like any surgical intervention, liposuction harms the body (a person has to take medication for a long time, which is certainly not useful).<br>
Anesthesia is also negatively reflected on the body, especially on the cardiovascular system.<br>
As it was proved by scientists, any operation increases the risk of oncological pathologies by about 25%, since a person has to endure great stress.<br>
The risk of the patient remaining unpleasant after the procedure.<br>
Whatever the painkillers prick, still not completely get rid of the pain after liposuction. Moreover, even after discharge, a person may suffer a painful syndrome for quite a long time, and discomfort in the operated zone is felt.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2780" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>The risk of infection is considered one of the biggest disadvantages. In this case, this complication is directly related to the purity of the operation and the sterility of further dressings.<br>
For this reason, it is important to carefully select a clinic and an experienced surgeon who will not make mistakes (most complications in patients develop exactly by medical fault, when the surgeon does not perform the proper liposuction technique or works under not sufficiently sterile conditions).<br>
A long period of recovery requires a lot of patience and effort.<br>
Despite the fact that the result of the operation will be noticeable at once, the operated tissues can be fully restored not earlier than in six months.<br>

If an infection or hematoma occurs, the patient may need a second operation.<br>
The risk of the appearance of various symptoms after anesthesia (trembling, migraine, weakness).<br>
With severe blood loss in humans, anemia may develop and a deficiency of nutrients may occur.</p><h3>INDICATIONS</h3><p>Direct indications for liposuction are:</p><ul>
<li>A disproportionately large volume of hands;</li>
<li>The presence of Wen’s in the shoulder area and the inner surface of the hands;</li>
<li>The presence of abundant fatty complications in the shoulder area, which could not be eliminated by diet and exercise;</li>
<li>It is also important to say that it is best to carry out this operation to patients with age from forty to fifty-five years, until their skin has not yet lost elasticity, otherwise otherwise, after the procedure, the skin may sag heavily.</li>

</div><h4>The disadvantages of laser liposuction are:</h4><ul>
<li>When it is carried out on the flabby skin, the patient may have creases;</li>
<li>The final result of the procedure will only be visible after two months;</li>
<li>Painful procedure.</li>
<li>As for ultrasonic liposuction, it is more often done than laser. Its essence is to remove fat with the help of low atmospheric pressure. Thus, the excess fat mass is literally pumped out with the help of special tubules inserted into the human body.</li>
</ul><h4>The advantages of the ultrasound method of liposuction are:</h4><ul>
<li>On the patient’s body there will be no ugly scars – only small round traces from the tubes;</li>
<li>Fairly fast rehabilitation period;</li>
<li>Low risk of bleeding.</li>
</ul><p>Cons of this operation are considered possible complications, and the reverse obesity of the patient.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2787" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-c3d894ba988b46f98a5d02a0525f92e8">

</div><h3>Recovery period.</h3><p>The recovery period after this surgery is two to six weeks. Usually it is fairly easy to tolerate by patients and does not cause negative consequences. In this case, a person after liposuction should be prepared for the fact that his body will hurt, there will be swelling and discomfort. Dizziness, migraine and nausea are also possible. These are normal effects of anesthesia, which will disappear a couple of days after the procedure.</p><p>Usually the seams are removed on the seventh day (if there are no complications). Dressings are done daily, even after discharge.</p><p>Also it is worth remembering that until the seams are removed and the wound is fully healed, it can not be wetted (especially it is not advisable to take a hot bath and visit the pool). If you perform all postoperative recommendations, then the recovery period will be many times simpler.</p><h3>POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS</h3><p>Most often after this operation, patients develop such complications:</p><ol>
<li>Pigmentation of the hands.</li>
<li>Hematoma.</li>
<li>Swelling of the hands.</li>
<li>Seroma (rarely).</li>
<li>Necrosis.</li>
<li>skin sagging.</li>
<li>Hyperesthesia.</li>
<li>Appearance of irregularities on the skin of the hands.</li>
<li>Violation of the proportionality and identity of the thickness of the hands.</li>
<li>Anemia.</li>
<li>Blood loss.</li>
<li>Infection.</li>
</ol><h3>The following factors can cause complications:</h3><ul>
<li>Non-compliance with sterility regulations during liposuction or even during dressings.</li>
<li>Non-compliance with the patient’s medical recommendations (especially weight lifting and agreement for surgery with obvious contraindications).</li>
<li>Incorrect operation technique, which resulted in excessive traumatization of the patient’s tissues.</li>
<li>Reduced immunity and general weakening of the human body during liposuction.</li>
</ul><h3>AVERAGE COST</h3><p>The price of liposuction depends on the complexity of the operation, its volume and the surgeon’s qualification.</p><h3>EXPERT ADVICE</h3><p>To avoid complications, one should adhere to such recommendations of doctors:</p><ol>
<li>Do not expect the impossible from the surgeon. He can only correct your figure a little. The rest is no longer in his power, because the patient must also lose weight independently with the help of diets and physical exercises.</li>
<li>Do not perform liposuction in the presence of serious pathologies, since this at times increases the risk of complications.</li>
<li>At the first visit to the surgeon you need to clearly understand what you want and formulate your desires in detail. Also, it is not superfluous to ask about the possible subtleties of the procedure and the side effects from its conduct.</li>
<li>In the first few days after liposuction you can not make any sudden movements of the hand. It is best to bandage it with an elastic bandage to reduce the risk of swelling.</li>
<li>You need to regularly make dressings.</li>
<li>At least one month should be abandoned physical exertion on the hands, especially lifting weights.</li>
<li>To recover faster, you need to eat well, but the diet should not be the same as before the operation. It is necessary to exclude from it fats, smoked products, sausages and other products that lead to rapid weight gain.</li>
<li>It is better to eat vegetables and fruits, nuts, cereals, and also drink juices.</li>
