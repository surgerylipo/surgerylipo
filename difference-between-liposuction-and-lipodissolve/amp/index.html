<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><i>Is Lipodissolve like Liposuction?</i></p><p>Lipodissolve is NOT like liposuction… Liposuction is a reliable, safe way to improve the body’s contour through surgical fat reduction. Lipodissolve is a poorly studied technique in which chemicals are injected under your skin to destroy the fat.</p><p>This is concerning because we don’t really know how those chemicals are affecting your blood vessels, nerves, and other tissues… It’s possible that if the chemicals are toxic enough to harm your fat (the goal), that they are also causing your blood vessels, nerves, etc, quite a bit of harm as well, and that this harm may not be evident for many years… I’m afraid this is another case of things that sound too good to be true really being too good to be true. This is not a procedure I would recommend.</p><p>If you want safe reduction in localized fat deposits, find a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon and discuss your goals with them. (Armando Soto, MD, FACS, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4140" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b84afbc2471436b99cf348a882e6f6e0">

</div><p>Lipodissolve is a method where chemicals are injected in to the fat to dissolve the fat cells. You may also hear the term Mesotherapy to describe this. I have seen several patients who have had Lipodissolve and Mesotherapy and unfortunately they did not have very good results and were unhappy.</p><p>None of the chemicals used are approved for the use of dissolving fat cells. In addition there is not standardized treatment protocol. When the chemical is injected, there is not way to control exactly where it goes or how much fat is dissolved.</p><p>This can lead to inconsistent and often unsatisfactory results. Liposuction is a surgical procedure where fat cells are removed in an operating room using a variety of instruments such as fine cannulas which can suck out the fat, laser assisted cannulas, water assisted cannulas and some mechanized cannulas as well.</p><p>No matter what the instrumentation, the fat is removed in a much more precise manner than Lipodissolve. (James H. Schmidt, MD (retired), Sarasota Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Lipodissolve is a poorly studied product that may have an indication to break up fatty deposits. If you want to remove the fatty excess in specific body areas, then I would suggest having liposuction. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Although non-surgical fat reduction sounds great, Lipodissolve is not the answer. All procedures performed by qualified physicians have been studied and found to be both safe and effective. Lipodissolve has not been shown to be either.</p><p>Furthermore, the substance injected is not FDA approved for any reason. The results after this procedure are highly unpredictable and may be very difficult to correct. There’s a reason liposuction is the most common cosmetic surgery for both men and women. (Jeffrey Horowitz, MD, Bel Air Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4142" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><b>Lipodissolve “results” look NOTHING like well-done Liposuction</b></p><p>Liposuction is the careful sculpting of individual fat layers while Lipodissolve is the injection of various chemical combinations hoping to bring about dissolution of fat. I have yet to see a truly happy patient from either Mesotherapy or Lipodissolve.</p><p>For the most part, many of these individuals underwent this procedure to avoid liposuction THINKING they were equivalent. Those who only lost money with Mesotherapy / Lipodissolve are the lucky ones. Many have painful lumps and irregularities which are VERY hard to treat. Don’t do it. (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Lipodissolve does not work. it is the injection of multiple chemicals and vitamins that is supposed to dissolve fat.</p><p>There is no shred of scientific evidence that it works. The main chemical Phosphtidyl Choline is not FDA approved for use in the U.S. There is no unified formula used. And no evidence it works.

</div><p><strong>Lipodissolve results can’t compare to liposuction</strong></p><p>Comparing Lipodissolve with Liposuction is like comparing T-ball practice with the World Series… They’re not even in the same ball park! Lipodissolve can make some small improvements, but when people push the procedure too far — that is, when they ask for better results than the procedure can really deliver, that is when they run into trouble.</p><p>I have seen more divits, dents, bumps, and infections from this stuff than from most other minimally invasive procedures. Liposuction is the real deal. If you really need debulking, your plastic surgeon can make a big difference in your life.</p><p>And, if you watch your lifestyle, you are very unlikely to ever need suctioning again. (Thomas P. Sterry, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4144" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Liposuction is the precise removal of fat from a particular area by a skilled surgeon. The surgeon can control everything. Lipodissolve is a chemical reaction which in variable in its effect and result. (Barry E. DiBernardo, MD, Montclair Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Lipodissolve is NOT Liposuction</h4><p>Mesotherapy can be used for very FINE sculpting but doesn’t come anywhere near Liposuction in its ability to remove fat. The predominant majority of people who seek out mesotherapy would be much better treated with Liposuction.</p><p>Lipodissolve is a mesotherapy treatment where a solution that is supposed to break up and dissolve fat is injected into specific areas. Mesotherapy treatments are unproven and result vary greatly from person to person. In my opinion spending money on Mesotherapy treatments is not an effective use of your money.

</div><h3>Liposuction alternative</h3><p>Lipodissolve has been shown to have at best a mild ability to remove fat deposits. It is best for small areas of excess fat, or may be as a touch up to liposuction surgery. Liposuction is by far superior modality when it comes to create a meaningful results in body contouring. (Boris M. Ackerman, MD, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Is Mesotherapy Equivalent to Liposuction?</h5><p>Mesotherapy, or Lipodissolve, involves the injection of a number of chemicals under the skin to essentially “dissolve” fat under the skin. This has not been well studied and is not FDA approved. For safety, liposuction is the way to go for diet-resistant fat. (Karen Vaniver, MD, Kennewick Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Lipodissolve is not FDA approved</em></p><p>Lipodissolve or mesotherapy is a technique which involves injecting chemicals into your fat in an attempt to “melt” the fat. This is not FDA approved and not recommended for body contouring. The chemicals that are injected are not standardized and not controlled.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4146" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The results of this procedure are very unpredictable. It is unclear where the “melted” fat ends up- it could be deposited in your liver for example. Traditional liposuction is a safe and proven method of body contouring and removing unwanted fat. (William Bruno, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Lipodissolve is not backed by the Plastic Surgery Societies. It is using drugs and chemicals off label so the side effects and toxicities are unknown. Currently, I have not seen or heard of any patient who is happy with their results.</p><p>There might be FDA approval of a drug for this purpose in the future, but for now, stay away. (Steven F. Weiner, MD, Panama City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Lipodissolve results NOT like liposuction results</h5><p>Lipodissolve does not produce predictable, satisfactory results for most people; whereas, liposuction does. Lipodissolve is a technique where chemicals are injected into the fat layer in an effort to destroy fat cells. Multiple injection sessions are usually recommended.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4147" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I have seen many patients who have tried this technique and have not been satisfied with the results. On the other hand, liposuction is an effective way to reduce fat that specifically removes unwanted fat by suctioning. (Lawrence Osman, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction is a popular and effective way to contour the body. This procedure is performed through very small incisions that can be placed into creases of your skin to minimize visibility. Thin cannulas can then be inserted into these incisions and fat is gently removed.</p><p>Lipodissolve as the technique where an enzyme is injected under your skin to help melt fat. These results are not as consistent as those with liposuction because it is difficult to determine exactly which area the enzyme will treat.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4148" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>For a consistent and predictable result, it is best to work with a board-certified plastic surgeon who has a great deal of experience in the many different flavors liposuction. (Pat Pazmino, MD, FACS, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You should AVOID mesotherapy which is also known as lipodissolve. Lipodissolve is rarely effective and patients can have allergic reactions to the cocktail of medications that are injected. The FDA has warned patients about mesotherapy / Lipodissolve and many companies that perform this procedure have declared bankruptcy due to lawsuits from unhappy patients.</p><p>These companies often reopen their doors under new names. Liposuction can be performed safely under both local and general anesthesia and create REAL results. You should consult with a board certified plastic surgeon for your body contouring needs so you do not waste your money or time and AVOID unnecessary pain. (Ankit Desai, MD, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Avoid mesotherapy and lipodissolve treatments!</h3><p>The problem with these injectional lipolysis techniques is that they are unpredictable- we have seen all sorts of contour abnormalities and skin issues related to these treatments. No wonder the FDA has cracked down on clinics offering these treatments.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4141" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d0c1fda4d7475f374f521bc49f94d14f">

</div><p>Liposuction is safe, effective and predictable when done by a board certified plastic surgeon in a controlled operating room environment. (Scott C. Sattler, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I too only see patients unhappy with Lipodissolve results for other treatment, but I think a common issue in unhappy Lipodissolve patients is “too much hype and not enough actual improvement.” Just be careful of what you expect. (John P. Di Saia, MD, Orange Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Lipodissolve is not like liposuction. Lipodissolve involves injecting chemicals under the skin to “melt” the fat away. The FDA just had a large crackdown on the medispas who were offering this. The FDA issue was these are not regulated, they have no standard solution, they gave false promises, and most importantly can be dangerous.</p><p>I had a patient who did mesotherapy who ended up in liver failure in the ICU. Liposuction on the other hand is well studied. It is safe when done by a trained plastic surgeon. The benefits are proven.</p><p>The key to fat removal, other than the obvious removing of the fat, is a smooth, contoured result. (Lauren Greenberg, MD, Palo Alto Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
