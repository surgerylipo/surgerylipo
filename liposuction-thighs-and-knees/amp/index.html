</div><h4>Anesthesia and duration of liposuction</h4><p>Local anesthesia is used for the operation. General anesthesia is most often used with combined liposuction of several parts of the body (legs, buttocks, thighs, abdomen). The duration of the operation is from half an hour to an hour, depending on the volume of fat cells that need to be removed.</p><h3>Methods of knees liposuction</h3><p>The following liposuction methods can be used:</p><ul>
<li>tumescent;</li>
<li>laser;</li>
<li>ultrasound;</li>
<li>cryolipolysis.</li>
</ul><h3>Tumescent (vacuum) liposuction</h3><p>This is a classic method, which includes the following steps:</p><h3>1. Preparation:</h3><ul>
<li>marking the zone in the knee area for liposuction;</li>
<li>treatment of this area with an antiseptic;</li>
<li>skin incision using a scalpel is not in aesthetically important areas;</li>
<li>installation of a special program for the device.</li>
</ul><h3>2. Liposuction:</h3><p>Injection of a special solution that dissolves fat;</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_12019" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-5f3bc633f45debb510b784afb432e11c">

</ul><h3>3. Completion:</h3><ul>
<li>suturing wounds;</li>
<li>installation of rubber graduates (they are removed one day later on the dressing);</li>
<li>Placement of sterile labels carefully covering the seams.</li>
</ul><p>This method is most suitable for young patients, since the cells of their skin are well contracted, its surface is leveled. For older people it is better to turn to other methods (for example, laser), as their skin can be reduced worse.</p><h3>Laser liposuction (lipolysis)</h3><p>The surgeon inserts into the incisions instruments that are equipped with a laser lightguide. Through the laser, destruction of adipose tissue occurs in the knee region, coagulation of damaged vessels. Then the fat is sucked from under the skin.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_12020" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-5a52d82d1a4013ba47c11d7492a04128">

</div><h3>Ultrasonic liposuction</h3><p>The destruction of fat deposits occurs due to the directed action of an ultrasonic wave, which increases local metabolic processes.</p><p>Depending on the amount of fat, it can be removed by cannula or by lymphatic drainage over time in a natural way.</p><p>An additional plus of laser liposuction (radiation property) is the effect of skin tightening due to active production of collagen and elastin.</p><h3>Cryolipolysis</h3><p>Destruction of fat cells is done with the help of a special contact device that creates artificial hypothermia. The destroyed cells are removed with a current of lymph.</p><h3>Recovery period</h3><p>Duration is from 3 to 5 weeks. The patient is hospitalized for the first 24 hours and then goes home. Within 2-3 days after the operation, it is recommended to be mainly in a horizontal position, gradually expanding the motor activity during the week. Also, antibiotics should be taken for the prevention of inflammation and festering of wounds after surgery. A mandatory requirement is the wearing of compression stockings from 2 to 4 weeks after surgery (so that the skin does not sag), which are absolutely not visible under the clothes and do not cause discomfort. During this period, you can not actively engage in sports, visit saunas, baths, solariums. Within two weeks, a slight swelling and bruising in the area of liposuction, tenderness during movement is possible. This is considered the norm and passes by itself.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_12021" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

And about the operation itself you will forget after a couple of weeks – from it will remain only minor traces from the incisions, visible only when scrutinized.</p><p><em>Important! When you follow all the recommendations of the doctor, the effect will be preserved forever.</em></p><ul>

</ul><h3>Thighs Liposuction</h3><p>Lush thighs often refer to the aesthetic defect of the body many women. Trying to reduce the amount of hips they resort to all sorts of diets and physical exercises. Active physical activity, of course, corrects the shape of the hips, but does not help reduce their volume. The diet allows you to reduce the hips, but at the same time the original proportions of the female body remain. With a significant reduction in weight, a woman may have other aesthetic problems, for example – the sagging of the breast or a significant decrease in its volume. Reliably to get rid of fat on thighs it is possible only by a method of surgical intervention. Liposuction of the thighs ensures a stable and noticeable result. The procedure for liposuction is relatively simple – it allows you to remove fat from the vast areas (which also include the hips) and do with minor scars.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_12022" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Reducing the volume of the hips by liposuction in a number of cases can be accompanied by irregularities in the surface of the region being operated. The presence of unevenness is directly related to the skill of the plastic surgeon. Often, patients who are dissatisfied with the results of liposuction from the primary surgeon come to our clinic. Eliminate the mistakes of the previous liposuction is quite feasible, but still, in order not to resort to a repeat procedure, you should more carefully choose a plastic surgeon. An experienced specialist will not only perform his work qualitatively and minimize possible complications, but will leave only positive emotions for the patient regarding the possibilities of plastic surgery as a whole.</p><p>Thighs and knees liposuction is performed under local anesthesia, but at the same time, with a large amount of fat removed, it is possible to use general anesthesia. This issue is discussed together with a plastic surgeon during the examination of the patient. The consultation also specifies all the details of the forthcoming operation and the subsequent recovery period.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_12023" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The procedure for fat removal in the hip area takes an average of 1.5-3 hours. In case of performing the operation under local anesthesia, the patient can leave the clinic one hour after liposuction. With the application of general anesthesia, the patient’s stay in the hospital for 1-3 days.</p><p>After liposuction of the thighs, the patient is indicated wearing compression garment for 3-4 weeks. On the 7-10th day, seams are removed. The first days after surgery, the patient may experience weakness and fever, minor pain and discomfort at the walk. During the recovery period, there may be edema, bruising, and a sensation of numbness in the operated region of the thighs. For 4-6 weeks, these symptoms completely disappear.</p><p>Despite the fact that many men like lush ladies’ shapes, excess weight in the lower part of the body spoils the body shape, creates difficulties in choosing clothes and makes women complex when there are elegant girlfriends nearby. Difficulties in removing fat in simple ways are related to the peculiarities of the hormonal background of women whose organism is set up for procreation.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_12024" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-736b2e8538ada09cab919d1448bab1ee">

</div><p>Fatty tissue is needed to produce estrogen, and they, in turn, increase the chance of conceiving and bearing a child. For this reason, the body places stocks of subcutaneous fat in the abdomen, hips and buttocks.</p><p>To get rid of excess fat you can use a modern technique called liposuction. The procedure corrects the contours of the body without strict diets and increased exercise.</p><h3>THIGH LIPOSUCTION: indications and contraindications</h3><p>The main indication for liposuction is the desire of a person, be it a woman or a man, to get rid of fat accumulation in a certain part of the body. If it is a question of the lower part of the trunk, usually the clients of plastic surgeons wish to remove fat in the inner region of the thighs or “ears” in the outer part.</p><p>Thigh liposuction has many contraindications, so before deciding to surgery, you need to discuss your health with a specialist. After a preliminary consultation, he will say whether it is possible to do liposuction in a specific case and will coordinate further actions of the patient.</p><h3>When lipolysis is contraindicated:</h3><ul>
<li>Herpes.</li>
<li>Diabetes.</li>
<li>Oncology.</li>
<li>Heart ailments.</li>
<li>Bad coagulability of blood.</li>
<li>Pregnancy and lactation.</li>
<li>Psychical deviations.</li>
<li>Menstrual period and 7 days before and after menstruation.</li>
</ul><p>If contraindications are not found, for 1 to 3 weeks before the scheduled operation a person should have a small examination (fluorography and an electrocardiogram) and tests for HIV, blood group and Rh factor, biochemical blood test, general urine analysis.</p><h3>Contraindications</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_12026" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-83e6c35ef7b5f8984a37bb8ce108c0bb">

</ul><p>Performing enhanced vacuum liposuction (oscillation type) is virtually identical to the standard lipolysis, but it is a feature of the cannula device. Needle is equipped with a manipulator, which creates high-frequency reciprocating motion. The procedure requires local anesthesia, it is characterized by a low risk of trauma to the skin.</p><p><strong>Vibration modeling (3D-lipomodeling)</strong>. Excess fat leaves the human body due to the operation of a special installation, which supplies compressed air to the adipocytes.</p><p>The destruction and pumping of processed lipids is carried out through the cannula. At a time, vibration simulation allows you to lose no more than 1.5 liters of fat. Judging by the doctors’ reviews, 3D liposuction is best suited for the inner surface of the thigh – a delicate area of the body. Postoperative complications vibromodeling provokes rarely.</p><p><strong>Ultrasound</strong>. The operation of ultrasonic liposuction is carried out as follows: through the incision on the body, the doctor inserts a special probe that emits ultrasound and destroys the adipocytes, i.e. fat cells. The processed lipids are removed through the cannula. In one session ultrasound can remove up to 8 liters of fat.<br>
<strong>Laser liposuction</strong>. In the subcutaneous space, the energy of the laser falls through the microneedle. There, it breaks the structure of lipids and burns them.<br>
<strong>Water jet liposuction</strong>. Lipolysis is carried out with the help of a thin stream of water, which enters the fatty layer under a great pressure and destroys adipocytes.<br>
<strong>Radiofrequency liposuction</strong>. The destruction of fat provides the impact of the Electrosurgical apparatus Body Tite, coupled with a computer and a high-frequency generator. In the desired region, the converted current is fed through a bipolar nozzle.<br>
<strong>Ultrasound and radiofrequency lipolysis</strong> are less commonly used in the plastic industry than other methods. This is due to the increased danger of burns of internal tissues. In clinics in the US and some European countries, both methods are officially banned.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_12028" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-6aaa92a21cd6736f863e7ba688b56fd0">

</div><p>The mechanical removal of fat stores does not affect the metabolic processes of the body. Therefore, in order to not return quickly to the previous weight after the procedure, it is necessary to follow a diet and take light physical activities.</p><h3>NON-SURGICAL TYPES OF LIPOSACTION</h3><p>The most effective method of rapid weight loss is a radical method of destruction of adipocytes. However, it does not always pass safely for the client, so cosmetologists seek to find an effective painless option and adjust the silhouette without surgery.</p><p>Mesotherapy as a way to combat excess fat is an introduction to a fat layer of a special cocktail that can stimulate natural lipolysis. The result of the procedure is not only an improved body shape. In the treated area, blood flow improves and specific immunity is activated.</p><p>Separate attention deserves mesodissolution. To perform the procedure, the specialist prepares a hypo-osmolar solution and injects it into the problem area of the trunk. The drug makes its way from the intercellular space to the lipocytes and affects their membranes, causing them to burst. The depth of the solution is determined by the thickness of the subcutaneous fat layer, but in general it is small only 10-12 mm or slightly deeper. To fully remove fat emulsion, doctors are advised to drink more fluid and engage in lymphatic drainage procedures.</p><p>Cavitation is another common variant of non-surgical liposuction, differs from conventional US lipolysis by the absence of incisions. The manipulator emitting ultrasonic waves moves in a strictly limited area.</p><p>The waves themselves reach adipocytes, breaking the skin barrier. To achieve a sustainable effect, cosmetologists recommend visiting 7-10 sessions of cavitation with interruptions of 8-10 days. By time, one procedure takes no more than 40 minutes. Other methods of non-surgical destruction of fatty deposits:</p><ul>
<li>Ozone therapy.</li>
<li>Electrolipolysis.</li>
<li>Cryolipolysis.</li>
<li>Endermological massage.</li>
</ul><p>The effectiveness of non-surgical liposuction of the hips can be assessed from the photos taken before and after the procedure.</p><h3>Side effects and recovery period</h3><p>Any intervention in the human body can lead to a variety of side effects, so a patient who wants to lose weight should be aware of the possible consequences of liposuction of the thighs.</p><p>Most often, people complain of a skin sensitivity disorder. This is due to the fact that in the process of destruction of adipose tissue, vessels and nerve fibers are affected. A few months after the procedure, discomfort passes.</p><p>The unevenness of the contours of the body as a side effect of liposculpturing takes place if the manipulation was performed by an inexperienced physician.</p><p>Uneven removal of fatty layer leads to the appearance of compacted areas and dents. Pain syndrome is the norm for lipolysis, because when a body is surgically corrected, the specialist makes punctures. Anesthetics help to minimize or eliminate discomfort.</p><p>Sagging of the skin is also considered a normal phenomenon after lipolysis, as the volume of adipose tissue is reduced, and the area of the skin remains unchanged. This problem is solved by wearing compression underwear. Dangerous complications of liposuction can be fat embolism and thromboembolism.</p><p>If the vessel is clogged with an adipocyte stopper, it is fatal. Surgical lipolysis with incisios and punctures of the skin can lead to suppuration, inflammation, swelling and scarring of the treated area.</p><p>In the first 6 – 8 hours of rehabilitation after liposuction of the thighs, the patient remains under the supervision of the medical staff. The next 2 – 3 days are recommended for a clinic. To prevent bacterial infection and accelerate natural regenerative processes, the doctor at this time appoints antibiotics and special preparations for tissue repair.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_12027" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d8ace6a67b21721f2ef7d633adea7cca">

</div><p>The recovery period after lipolysis passes in most cases easily and painlessly. Some discomfort may be present for a month, but it is associated with the wearing of compression underwear.</p><h3>The cost of thighs and buttocks liposuction</h3><p>The price for liposuction of the thighs and buttocks is set taking into account the volume of surgical or non-invasive intervention. The final cost of lipolysis is affected by several factors:</p><ul>
<li>The level of the clinic.</li>
<li>Professionalism of the doctor.</li>
<li>The method of anesthesia used.</li>
<li>The number of points for the incisions.</li>
<li>Duration and conditions of postoperative maintenance.</li>
</ul><h3>REVIEWS</h3><p>According to the reviews of women who tried to remove excess fat from the buttocks and thighs with liposuction, the effect procedure gives an instant. The operation consists in pumping molten lipids from the interior of organic cells.</p><p>If the epidermis does not have a high elasticity, an additional cosmetic operation may also be necessary in the form of eliminating flabby areas. Thus, liposuction gives the best effect in the presence of elastic from the nature of the skin.</p></div>
