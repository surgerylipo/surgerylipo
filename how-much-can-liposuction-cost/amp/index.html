<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Fees for a liposuction procedure are highly variable and typically depend on a combination of factors, such as, facility location, board certified surgeon expertise and experience, number of areas to be treated, and technique employed.</p><p>In my practice, liposuction fees typically begin around $4,750 and can go up from there, depending upon what is discussed and elected at the time of a patient’s consultation appointment.</p><p>Liposuction “bundles” are very common throughout the country as well, since multiple liposuction areas are generally offered at slightly discounted rates for patients.</p><p>I would strongly recommend to anyone interested in a liposuction procedure to consult with a board certified plastic surgeon.</p><p>Keep in mind that the cheapest deal for liposuction is sometimes more costly in the long run, as price will often reflect the experience of that particular plastic surgeon.

</div><p>Liposuction is a highly variably priced procedure. Why? Liposuction is a combination of artistic sculpting and the use of a machine, i.e. the liposuction machine. A liposuction machine can only remove fat at a certain rate.</p><p>Therefore, if a large volume/amount of liposuction needs to be done this will require a longer time in the operating room.</p><p>Unfortunately, reputable certified operating rooms are expensive. Thus, the more liposuction that need to be done; the longer it takes in the operating room; and the more it costs.</p><p>Depending on the area(s) you want treated by liposuction it may require position changes during surgery. Position changes take time in the operating room and also add to the cost.</p><p>Why does this matter? Because while performing additional areas are typically less; if the additional areas require position changes then it may not be as significant.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5441" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>Great liposuction is separated by the artistic eye and artistic sculpting. This usually requires delicate shadowing, blending, and feathering.</p><p>This takes time. And again, time incurs costs in the operating room. My best advice that I give to my family and friends are: Good Quality and Quality Control incur an expense.</p><p>At some point, in order to cut cost the quality gets cut and more importantly the Quality Control or Safety gets cut. (Matthew J. Nykiel, MD, Ontario Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction cost varies based upon the number of body regions treated and the time it will take to perform surgery. Costs may run as low as $3K for just neck liposuction, but will run higher as the number of body regions increases.</p><p>Average may be around $6K, but could go up to around $10K. (Michele A. Shermak, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5442" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-cea6b06a8463664986da34bca9aea26d">

</div><p>Liposuction costs vary depending the number of areas treated. Some surgeons charge according to time spent per zone. An in person consultation is best to assess cost for this procedure. (John Nguyen, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Generally discounts are applied when you choose to have liposuction on multiple areas. Prices range based on the area and the expected length of surgery.</p><p>Prices also vary widely by regional area. Best to obtain multiple consultations from board certified plastic surgeons. (Richard Zienowicz, MD, Providence Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The type of anaesthetic depends on your preference and chosen treatment. At our clinic, a liposculpture costs $ 1.415 excl. VAT for the first area. For the second and third area you pay $ 1.131 excl. VAT and from the 4th region and more, the fee is $ 791 excl.VAT per additional region.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5443" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-3cee75a5ec0b5d23d5f6bb66c48f3302">

Only the surgeon can provide you with detailed information about the options. The intake discussion with the surgeon is important for achieving an optimal, beautiful final result. The fee for a consultation is $ 40 excl.VAT.(Luc Damen, MD, Belgium Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The best approach to getting costs for liposuction is to have a formal consultation with a Board-certified Plastic Surgeon. The doctor and staff will evaluate you thoroughly ,address your concerns and then make suggestions as to the optimal approach to achieve your goals.</p><p>Costs will be discuss in detail at that visit .

</div><p>When researching liposuction options it is very common to find a range of pricing depending on the surgeons office preference. I typically will price liposuction by the area for my practice.</p><p>I have found that basing liposuction pricing by the area my patients feel more in control of their surgery cost as well as the procedure.</p><p>One area constitutes both sides of the body which means if we are focusing on the inner thigh area the price quoted will encompass treatment to both the right and left inner thigh.</p><p>As part of your quote you will find the facility fee, anesthesia fee, as well as your post-operative kit which includes everything you will need for post-operative care included. By including all fees in one quote there is much less confusion on what is included.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5445" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-195da8fb3d7204625cf049dc2e131a8d">

</div><p>An average price for liposuction for a single are (inner thighs= right and left inner thigh) typically is around $4400. I absolutely will offer discounts for additional areas added. (Patrick Viscardi, MD, South Bend Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I charge $6000 for the legs/abdomen and $3100 for other smaller areas. Prices are surgeon-dependent. (Ronald Levine, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost depends on the amount of time required for the procedure, the number of areas treated, if it is done in an office or in an accredited surgical center and on the type of anesthesia involved.</p><p>Also, doctor’s experience will usually come at a premium. Most discount or Groupon liposuction offices cut out many safety and comfort expenses. You may also not be treated by a plastic surgeon who is experienced in liposuction. (Yuly Gorodisky, DO, FACOS, Oxnard Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Costs for liposuction vary depending on the surgeon, region and treatment area.</i></p><p>The exact costs for liposuction depend on a range of factors. For one, cosmetic procedures have different average prices in different regions. Secondly, different surgeons charge different prices, based partially on their credentials. Keep in mind that when it comes to your physical appearance, it may be a better idea to invest in a high quality procedure than take a risk.</p><p>Finally, the costs also depend on the size of the treatment area. As for your question on discounts for multiple treatment areas, it depends on the practice. Some practices may offer a deal, but it’s best not to assume that all surgeons will offer a discount for multiple treatments. (Lee B. Daniel, MD, Eugene Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction packages range from $2500 to $8500 depending on the number areas of liposuction indicated. Discounts range and are usually applied as additional areas are added. Providers may also having pricing based on additional factors such as sedation used (local, IV, general), BMI, or facility type (surgical center, hospital).</p><p>Prices also vary based on your location as different markets have different average market pricing. (Jeffrey Weinzweig, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The fee for liposuction can be divided into three fees. The fee for the anesthesia, the fee for the surgical facility and the fee for the surgeon. The costs vary from region to region across the country. (Francis X. Fleming, MD, Kennewick Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The costs vary from city to city I would recommend visiting a few Board Certified Plastic Surgeons and find one that you feel comfortable with. Cost of Liposuctions depends on multiple factors such as how much volume will be removed and how many areas will be liposuctioned.</p><p>In my practice, I discount every area after the first area liposuctioned. (Jeff Angobaldo, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The price for liposuction will vary based upon how many areas you are having done, how much fat you’re removing and how dense the fat is. We offer free consultations so that you can come in to learn about the procedure (SmartLipo), receive answers to all of your questions and also get a no obligation price quote. (David Dellinger, DO, FACOS, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Average cost of Liposuction</em></p><p>The average cost of liposuction depends much on the area suctioned, how much is suctioned and the complexity of the case involved. Getting a consultation with your plastic surgeon, would better narrow your cost for a better rate.</p><p>However, a ball park estimate would be somewhere between $2500 to $8000. Discounts are dependent on the office and physician policy. (Alexander G. Digenis, MD, Louisville Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
