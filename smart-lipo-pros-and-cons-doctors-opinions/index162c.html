The fat in the superficial layer is melted. A cannula is then placed under the skin to suction out the melted fat.</p><p>The internal cooking may leave an uneven appearance to the treated areas since it is right under the skin.

</div><p>In my area not a single board certified plastic surgeon performs laser assisted liposuction even with all the marketing and hype. (Chad K. Wheeler, MD, Spokane Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Smart Lipo Not So Smart</h3><p>Smart Lipo is a laser-assisted liposuction that is heavily promoted as being less invasive and traumatic that regular liposuction, claiming it selectively targets fat. FALSE! Smart Lipo is causing all the tissues to heat up, not just the fat.</p><p>There are no compelling, objective scientific studies that support the claims that Smart Lipo is more selective or less traumatic. In fact, a recent report in the Aesthetic Surgical Journal actually states that complications including contour irregularities, burns, scarring and unsatisfactory results are commonly associated with Smart Lipo and that 65% of plastic surgeons that once used this method are no longer employing it.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_11056" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I, like many board certified surgeons, am not convinced with studies regarding the effectiveness, as well as safety, of this procedure and therefor do not offer it at my practice. (Brad Herman, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>SmartLipo vs Traditional Liposuction</h5><p>The most important factor in having a successful treatment is physician selection. Make sure that your physician is well-trained and experienced in the procedure. A board-certified dermatologist or plastic surgeon with many years of experience who has performed many cases without complications is the best bet.</p><p>With all else being equal, then the results with SmartLipo are better than with traditional liposuction. I’ve performed side-by-side comparisons doing traditional liposuction on one side and SmartLipo on the other side in the same patient and the side receiving SmartLipo had faster recovery time and more skin tightening than the traditional liposuction side.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_11057" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>Cynosure also has studies supporting this. I was very skeptical about the benefits of laser-assisted liposuction until Cynosure came out with the SmartLipo Triplex with 3 wavelengths (1064 and 1320 and 1440 nm). This is the newest generation of SmartLipo and a big technologic advance.</p><p>I had not been impressed with results from their previous generation devices. That device finally convinced me that liposuction using this device is superior to traditional liposuction. The fat comes out much easier, there is less bleeding and bruising, and the skin tightening effects are remarkable.</p><p>The results especially show in challenging regions where skin laxity is a major issue such as the upper arms (“bat wings”) and chin/neck. Also for “mommy tummies” where abdominoplasty (tummy tuck) might have been needed am seeing less need after using SmartLipo. (M. Christine Lee, MD, Walnut Creek Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_11058" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-b4ce11390ef852fc1df830de3566001b">

</div><p>In an experienced Board Certified Plastic Surgeon’s hands, the type of liposuction should have no bearing on the final result. The pros of SmartLipo in my experience is that there is less postoperative bruising, swelling, and pain so that the overall recovery is somewhat easier.</p><p>It does not provide an advantage in the final result, however, which you will not see for around six months following your procedure. (Brian Howard, MD (retired), Alpharetta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Having performed both procedures. I truely feel that Smart Lipo Triplex is vastly superior. The procedure takes longer but, is done under local anethesia. The laser under the skin does tighten the skin. The laser into the fat melts the fat allowing more to be removed for better sculpting.</p><p>The built in heat control make the procedure extremely safe. (David A. Bray, Sr., MD, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_11059" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>I recommend see 2-3 Board Certified Plastic Surgeons and at least one who offers Smart Lipo or another laser option. Do not be swayed by one brand of laser for liposuction. The claims are frequently overstated.</p><p>The surgeon is the ultimate important factor in this. The surgery is a success because of the surgeon and his or her training and experience. (Sonia Badreshia-Bansal, MD, Bay Area Dermatologist)</p><p>The skin and fat are thinner here than most of the body. The laser-assisted liposuction you underwent might have created a panniculitis, or inflammation, of the fatty layer. You should see your doctor to determine if a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent could be beneficial. (Ronald Shelton, MD, Manhattan Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Smartlipo versus traditional liposuction</b></p><p>We have been using the Smartlipo technique for the past three years and are very impressed with the results. So much so that now even patients who could benefit from traditional liposuction will opt to do the Smartlipo in order to be able to return to regular activities more quickly.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_11060" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>The compressive garment needs to be worn for 4 weeks for a traditional liposuction versus only 2 weeks for Smartlipo. (V. William Papanastasiou, MD, Montreal Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Smart Lipo is not so smart. It hurts longer because the fat in the protective sheaths around nerves is also melted. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons already has reviewed the subject and decided that there is no long term difference in skin tightness. (Ricardo L. Rodriguez, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There is no scientific evidence that the so called (smart liposuction) gives better results that traditional liposuction. The skill of the plastic surgeon and attention to details is what makes the difference. (Farhad Rafizadeh, MD, Morristown Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Liposuction and SmartLipo compliment one another</em></p><p>Liposuction is a superb technique to help people achieve shape changes with minimal downtime and risk. In particular, tumescent liposuction is the gold standard by which other fat removal techniques are measured. SmartLipo, as well as other laser assisted liposuction procedures, such as ProLipo Plus, SlimLipo, and others, are adjuncts to the liposuction procedure that can help your doctor achieve a more pleasing result.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_11061" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Not all lasers are created equal, and not all liposuction surgeons are created equal either. There is still substantial debate as to whether these lasers really add value, but in skilled hands they appear to enhance results.</p><p>But the first key is to have a skilled liposuction surgeon behind the wheel. Liposuction, whether with or without the laser, is one of those procedures where the doctor holding the wand really does determine final result.</p><p>Just because a doctor has a laser doesn’t mean the results will be what you want. Do your homework. (Michael S. Kaminer, MD, Chestnut Hill Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Not sure SmartLipo has pros</b></p><p>Now that most practitioners are ending the “SmartLipo” procedure with regular old lipo to remove the liquified fat, I’m trying to figure out why that’s better than just doing standard tumescent lipo to begin with.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_11062" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I have yet to see convincing photographic results to show that SmartLipo produces more favorable skin tightening tahn standard lipo. Without doubt, the technique has been insanely marketed and hyped up before there has been any meaniingful data to support the claims.</p><p>In my community, very few (if any) board-certified plastic surgeons use it. (John LoMonaco, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Lipo vs Smart Lipo</strong></p><p>This has been studied and there is no difference. Smartlipo is more marketing than medicine. One comment I heard is that the only thing “smart” about smartlipo is the word “smart” in it. So, as most of the board certified plastic surgeons have stated here, the traditional liposuction in the experienced hands will give you the same result.</p><p>Be careful of marketing that is all sizzle and no substance. (Bahram Ghaderi, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_11063" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-36c24cac843449a763e341d04c3080b6">

</div><p><b>Go with the Board Certified Plastic Surgeon</b></p><p>I would recommend you go with the one who is a board certified plastic surgeon. You will find that most of the plastic surgeon would tell you there is no difference and that smartlipo is just a gimmick.</p><p>I fully believe that the same results can be achieved in my hands with traditional lipo as can be achieved with smartlipo. So be careful who you choose for your plastic and cosmetic surgery. (Farbod Esmailian, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Potential better result with the more qualified physician</h3><p>It is understanding that it might be confusing which technology is the best one to go with. Instead of choosing the technology, I would suggest you choose the physician who is most qualified. Physicians who are plastic surgeons and who are board certified by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons are usually the best trained and most experienced.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_11064" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>To be a plastic surgeon who is Board certified by the ASPS they have at least 6 years of training and experience in surgery, with 3 years specifically in plastic surgery. They adhere to a strict code of ethics, are required to fulfill continuing education requirements. (Andrew Y. Kleinman, MD, Westchester Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Liposuction is not Smart or Dumb</i></p><p>Smart liposuction generally costs a lot more for a lot less, and is usually done by non-plastic surgeons. I feel it is a marketing gimic to capture cosmetic patients. I would save your money, and go to a plastic surgeon who is experienced at the procedure, and management of liposuction patients. (Scott E. Kasden, MD, FACS, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Arm yourself with the pros and cons about SmartLipo</strong></p><p>Ultimately you should arm yourself with the facts and make an educated decision yourself according to your goals and your personal history. Smart Lipo is a fat-melting device, an alternative to liposuction that uses a technique known as Laser Lipolysis.</p><p>Because it’s so targeted, we can treat areas that are harder to get to, like the neck jowels and love handles, as well as your thighs, hips and stomach. Compared to traditional liposuction, SmartLipo causes less bleeding, bruising and swelling.</p><p>Best of all, since the procedure doesn’t involve physically breaking up the fat, patients only require a local anaesthetic, which means a quicker recovery time. Research and surgeon reviews suggest that heating from the laser makes the liposuction procedure quicker, provides skin tightening with less recovery time.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_11066" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>It has been FDA Approved since 2006. Other benefits include: reduced bleeding, bruising and swelling, decreasing the patient’s downtime; significantly improved tissue tightening; less tissue invasion and disruption; postoperatively, compression garments need to be worn only for a few days. (Barry Lycka, MD – Account Suspended, Edmonton Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Unless you have a very small, soft collection of fat, you will need some form of more traditional liposuction. Laser lipo can be combined with traditional lipo for enhanced results. (Edmond A. Zingaro, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The different techniques and machines involved in surgery may enhance the results however they are still operator dependent. The skill level of each surgeron varies. Decide which doctor you trust more and go with him or her.</p><p>My suggestion is not to base your decision on the technique. (Charles Perry, MD, Sacramento Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Find out if one is doing true tumescent and then go with them.</i></p><p>Smart Lipo is simply a laser that is done along with another method of fat removal. While I perform Smart Lipo and like it very much, it alone is not the only thing that you need to evaluate when having a procedure done.</p><p>The method used along with it to collect the fact is more important, if anything, than what is done along with it. If you want quick recovery time and less bruising as well as less risk with the procedure, you need to make sure that the Smart Lipo doctor is doing the true tumescent method along with it.</p><p>Sadly, there are quite a few non-qualified doctors who have started doing laser liposuction as a ploy, but they have very limited skills other than having enough money to purchase a laser. On top of this, many don’t even bother to purchase the Smart Lipo laser by Cynosure, but simply buy a ‘knock-off’ and advertise that they have the real laser.</p><h4>Questions to ask of your prospective surgeon:</h4><ol>
<li>Do you use anything other than tumescent anesthesia to numb me up? If they answer yes, you probably aren’t getting the right procedure and will have much longer recovery period.</li>
<li>Do you use strong sedatives prior to the procedure? Again, if they do, you probably will have a longer and more risky recovery period.</li>
<li>Will I be awake during the procedure? If you aren’t, they are not using the right method and you will have a recovery period that is longer.</li>
<li>Ask to see which cannulas they use for the procedure. They should be about the size of a sippy straw. If they are the size of a real straw, they are using the wrong kind for tumescent liposuction and you will have much more bruising, pain and recovery time.</li>
<li>Do you do this in a hospital OR? If they do, they are performing the wrong kind of liposuction. While many different specialties can do this type of procedure, I tend to feel that dermatologists do the best and safest kind of liposuction, while having the quickest recovery times, but each doctor is different and it all comes down to finding the right person and seeing pictures of their OWN work (not some company picture) and hopefully knowing people who have been to them in order to find out how they really are rather than a glitzy sales job. (Joel Schlessinger, MD, Omaha Dermatologic Surgeon)</li>

</div><h4>If It Sounds Too Good to Be True, It Probably Is…</h4><p>You’ve gotten a lot of opinions on this thread, from real, board-certified plastic surgeons and non-plastic surgeon cosmetic practitioners. If you decide to have a procedure performed with a fancy device, make sure you understand that there is no magic to plastic surgery.</p><p>The old adage applies: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Many non-plastic surgeons are spending big bucks buying hot new machines in an attempt to break into the cosmetic market.</p><p>Make sure you feel comfortable with the surgeon you choose, and make sure they are not selling you a service in order for them to make payments on their expensive lease.</p><p>If all else fails, see a number of surgeons certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery, and go with the one you feel most comfortable with.
