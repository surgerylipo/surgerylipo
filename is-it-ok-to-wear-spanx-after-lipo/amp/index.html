<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Right after liposuction it’s best to be in a specific liposuction compression garment. Each surgeon will have their own recommendations about the length of time to be in a surgical garment before transitioning to an off-the-shelf garment like a Spanx.</p><p>Ask your surgeon what s/he prefers. Your results are determined by the fat removal procedure and not by the garment that you wear after lipo, however. Be sure to discuss this with your surgeon and the staff. (Kimberly Finder, MD, San Antonio Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Are Spanx OK after Liposuction instead of Compression Garments?</i></p><p>Discuss this with your surgeon.

</div><p>Most surgeons use some type of compression following liposuction.</p><p>I like Spanx since they work well and are more affordable. I now only recommend 2-3 weeks for post op compression. (Kurtis Martin, MD, Cincinnati Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Liposuction Recovery Using Compression Garments or Spanx</strong></p><p>Compression garment should be used in the first two weeks after liposuction to decrease the swelling and minimize complications.</p><p>You can switch to a contour garment (spanx) after 2-3 weeks and wear it for an additional 4 weeks. (Jeff Angobaldo, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Many surgeons believe strongly in compression garments and have strong preference in the type of garment. That being said, most of my patients do not use garments at all, and if they do it is only for comfort.</p><p>Spanx are a reasonable choice. However, if they are short they may cause swelling below where they end, so it is important to discuss this with your surgeon. (Thomas A.

</div><p>I generally advise patients wear their compression garment, not spanx (as spanx won’t provide the same amount of compression), for 3 weeks after surgery, day and night, then after that 3 more weeks just in the day.</p><p>However, your surgeon may have different advice.(Jerome Edelstein, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Medical garment for the first month, then Spanx</h4><p>Compression after liposuction is an important part of the recovery, and can have a positive effect on the outcome. We use garments that are specifically designed for liposuction, and are made out of material with very specific, scientifically-proven compression properties.</p><p>These garments give the smoothest outcome because the compression is even across the entire surface of the garment. After one month, Spanx or any other type of garment would be fine, as patients often feel best when wearing compression, even for several months after surgery.

</div><p>A good post-liposuction compression garment is a must! I believe that you should wear a medical grade compression garment for at least the first 4 weeks after surgery. Medical garments provide more compression post surgery, and further guarantee the best possible results.</p><p>Smart Lipo triplex patients tend to wear the garment for a shorter period of time. (Arthur M. Cambeiro, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Compression garments after liposuction are key to good results. Liposuction removes the fat cells under the skin but compression and time allows the skin to retract and “stick back down” to reach the final result.</p><p>I believe that a medical grade compression garment is important especially in the first 3-4 weeks 24/7 and then the last 2-4weeks Spanx would be adequate compression.

</div><p>For all of the reasons noted in this thread, true compression is essential for an optimal post-liposuction result. We used binders or modified girdles in our practice which are tight and conforming to the area liposuctioned.</p><p>Loose garments with minimal tightness look pretty but do not accomplish control of the swelling or prevention of fluid accumulation (seromas).(Douglas J. Raskin, MD, Colorado Springs Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>The Appropriate Spanx Garment is Satisfactory Following Liposuction</i></p><p>Liposuction is performed by breaking up the fat with a specialized hollow blunt tube. This tube is called a cannula. Once the fat is broken up, it is suctioned from the tube through a hose into a container.</p><p>Removal of fat in this manner leaves tunnels with the same diameter as the tube itself. If you could see this tissue afterward, it looks like a honeycomb. It is important to have all of these canals uniformly collapse in order to achieve the smoothest result.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5423" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>For that reason, compression garments are normally utilized for a period of time after any type of liposuction. In general, any type of compression garment that provides uniform, even compression is satisfactory. Many times, the appropriate Spanx garment is satisfactory.</p><p>There are many other compression garments on the market intended for treating the liposuction patient. It is very important to follow the direction of your surgeon when selecting the appropriate garment postoperatively. (John J. Edney, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A well-fitted compression garment is a must for the first four weeks following liposuction. I require my patients to wear the garment 24/7 for the first four weeks. They can switch to a Spanx type garment after four weeks but it is still important to wear one that provides a good amount of support in the surgical area.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5424" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-3cee75a5ec0b5d23d5f6bb66c48f3302">

</div><p>A proper garment is a must to aid with swelling after liposuction and wearing the garment as instructed can actually help you see the optimum results from your surgery sooner. Follow the advice of your plastic surgeon.</p><p>He or she will guide you in the recovery process. The garments can be uncomfortable but the goal is to achieve a great result. (Christopher J. Morea, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Spanx are not as effective as compression garments. In order to ensure a proper recovery it is important to use the compression garments as they are designed specifically to prevent swelling and complications after surgery.</p><p>At our practice we usually have our patients wear their compression garments for a minimum of 3-4 weeks.

</div><p>I give patients compression garments for their recovery following liposuction. They have a higher level of compression than Spanx. Patients may transition to Spanx after two or three weeks. (David Stoker, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Although Spanx are excellent to wear as a long term garment, they are not ideal for the initial recovery phase because they don’t tend to compress enough and they are not easy to put on in the early phase while the person is sore.</p><p>You should use a regular compression garment, those that are designed for liposuction. Later on, after 1 month or 2 months the spanx garments can be useful and certainly more comfortable at that point as well. (Mel T. Ortega, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I would recommend excellent compression garments for 6 weeks. 50% of your end result is due to the amount of compression during the postoperative period. Excellent postop compression makes all the difference in my opinion. (Paul S. Gill, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5426" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>Actually I instruct to my patients, use an appropriate post surgery garment for about 4-6 weeks. (Jhonny Salomon, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Spanx vs regular compression garments after liposuction</strong></p><p>While Spanx and similar products have their place, these products cannot deliver the level of compression necessary after a liposuction procedure. At my Cleveland plastic surgery practice, my patients wear their compression garment 24 hours a day for the first few weeks, after which they can eliminate it IF swelling has gone down.</p><p>Spanx and similar products can work “after” this period, IF my patient brings it in for me to see how tight it is.</p><p>I also recommend that all my Cleveland liposuction patients have post-procedure massage on the treated areas to help soften the treated areas, foster fluid drainage and provide comfort. (Paul Vanek, MD, Cleveland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A stage one compression garment is highly recommended for the first 2 weeks post surgery. This heavier garment really helps with swelling and bruising post-procedure. After the first 2 weeks a lighter Spanx garment is worn for a total of 2 months post surgery. (Jeffrey W. Hall, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I perform many liposuction procedures and believe strongly in using compression garments. Such garments are superior to less compressive garments such as Spanxs. The reason for their greater effectiveness is quite simply their greater compression.</p><p>Appropriate compression is needed in order to press the skin tightly against the body which limits swelling and gross fluid collection. As the swelling subsides the skin is compressed further. the less the skin is compressed the more it can stretch and droop after fat removal.</p><p>The obvious issue is that patients like things that are more comfortable. We all do. Spanx are clearly more comfortable and many patients prefer them, but they simply don’t compress as well as standard compression garments. (Jay Burns, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Proper selection of post-liposuction garment.</h3><p>Ideally the patient ought to wear a well pre-fitted post-liposuction garment for at least a week. There are a number of factors to consider when pre-fitting a patient for this, your surgeon ought be be able to explain to you his choice in the garment.</p><p>In our practice in addition to the garment we fit our patient with a special foam, which greatly reduces bruising and swelling. After the first 7-10 days it is adequate to wear a properly sized spanx type of a garment, which is worn for another 3-4 Weeks. (Boris M. Ackerman, MD, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Spanx are acceptable for compression</i></p><p>Immediately after liposuction, the zippers and contours of a specific post-surgical garment can be the most comfortable . However, often within 1-2 weeks of surgery a strong Spanx garment that provides compression to the affected areas can be substituted for the stage I post-surgical garment.</p><p>This transition should be discussed with your surgeon. (Emily A. Williams, MD, Spokane Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction Garments are used by most liposuction surgeons. They are a doubled edged sword though. Liposuction garments are used to decrease post liposuction swelling, but at the risk of causing what is called a “Garment Deformity,” therefore, it is important for patients to be followed closely after having liposuction and using a garment.</p><p>The risk of deformities goes up with garments, if your surgeon is doing “skin tightening” technique (superficial liposuction). There is a misconception that many patients have about garments, though, is that it makes the skin flatten out better.</p><p>The truth is, that even if a patient did not use a garment, they would in all likelihood experience the same result. It would just take longer for recovery and there discomfort after the procedure would be increased.</p><p>I typically have my patients where there garments for at least two weeks after surgery and if they have had significant skin tightening technique (superficial liposuction) I have them where their garments for 4 weeks. (John Millard, MD, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In my experience Spanx offer a good amount of post-surgical compression. However, your board certified plastic surgeon needs to be able to fit the garment to your body before the operation, so you’ll need to bring your Spanx to your pre-op visit.</p><p>Spanx may also be more difficult to adjust. If you need less compression because of post-surgical pain a regular surgical garment can often be loosened, Spanx can’t be. Also, be prepared to throw your Spanx away after you heal, you may have discoloration of the material from small amounts of blood or fluid. (Elizabeth Morgan, MD, PhD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Each plastic surgeon has his or her own preference for compression after liposuction. Often a grament is worned for the first few weeks and then spanks or equivalent can be worn for the remainder of the recovery.</p><p>Its best to touch base with your plastic surgeon office and see what they think.
