<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>The length of recovery after liposculpture depends on many things and the most important of them are the amount of fat removed, the number of areas that were treated, the type of liposculpture that person has, the general health of the patient as well as the skill of the doctor performing the procedures. (Mariusz Sapijaszko, MD, FRCPC, Edmonton Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Recovery from liposculpture can vary from patient to patient and from procedure to procedure. Large volume liposculpture can require 1-2 weeks off from work. Small liposculpture procedures can involve minimal recovery usually just a few days.</p><p>The swelling lasts about 6 months. You can generally exercise in a few days. The more fat removed the longer the recovery.

</div><p><b>Recovery very much depends on how your liposculpture is performed</b></p><p>There are essentially two standards of care for liposculpture. Under general anesthesia: This is typically how liposculpture is performed by general plastic surgeons. Liposculpture can be performed very effeciently.</p><p>The surgeon can blast away because the patient is completely out.</p><p>However, pain management can be an issue due to the procedural trauma. This can also cause a slow recovery.</p><p>Some surgeon still keep their patients in compression garment for 6 weeks. In constrast, liposculpture is also performed under local anesthesia.</p><p>This is typically how dermatologists and other cosmetic surgeons perform liposculpture. Because the patient is awake and aware, the procedure is done more slowly with microcannulas. Overall the same amount of fat can be removed by it takes longer.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4929" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>Because the local anesthesia sticks around for about a pain, there is minimal post-operative pain. Typically, people find that they can return to their work-out and work in two days. Compression garments are worn for only about 5 or 6 days. (Kenneth D. Steinsapir, MD, Beverly Hills Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Liposuction recovery time</h5><p>Five days is typically enough time for liposculpture recovery, back to light activity in most situations. However, in more extensive cases (for example 2-3+ liters of suction) you may feel tired at 5 days post op. (Craig W. Colville, MD, FACS, Toledo Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Back to Work in a Week or So</em></p><p>The first thing to consider is the extent of the procedure. Someone undergoing fairly extensive liposculpture of the abdominal area or flanks will generally need to take a week off from work, and more if returning to a job that involves strenuous labor.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4930" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Even after returning to work, you may still experience discomfort, swelling, and bruising for several more weeks. The final results can take 2 to 4 months to be fully noticeable. As others have said, the first few days after liposculpture will be the most challenging.</p><p>Prescription pain medicine can manage the discomfort. (Arthur M. Cambeiro, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Downtime depends on what you plan on doing afterwards</h3><p>I have done liposculpture on many women who are professional dancers and I tell them that in order to get back in your best wage earning shape you need about 6 weeks to allow for most of the swelling etc. to go down and resume normal flexibility and exercise.</p><p>If you are not doing any work that is labor intensive like dancing etc. you can get back to work in a couple of days.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4931" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>You will need to wear a compression garment. The more you wear it the better the result will be. I recommend at least 6 weeks. (Dev Wali, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Liposuction recovery is only days</h4><p>Everyone is different in their recovery. In 30 years of liposculpture, the average time is a week. Some patients wear their binder to work after 4 days. (Toby Mayer, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In my clinic we practice the 24-hour recovery strategy. The day of surgery a patient goes home and naps. Then they get up and take a hot shower wearing their garment without the absorbent dressings inside.</p><p>They perform specific stretches every hour while awake. This has represented a revolution in the rapidity of recovery after liposculpture, breast augmentation, abdominal plasty Etc. (Marshall T. Partington, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4932" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>For small liposculpture cases under local anesthesia, most patients are able to return to work immediately. For larger liposculpture procedures, it is typically good to rest for 1-3 days before returning to work. I recommend patients wait at least one week before returning to exercise. (David Stoker, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Liposuction: how long does recovery take?</em></p><p>The surgeon will also instruct you on the period of time to wait before normal activities and exercise can be continued. Patients can expect to resume normal activities in 1-2 weeks, office work in 3-5days, active jobs in 14days, exercise in 2weeks, walking, swimming, or riding a stationary bicycle a few days after surgery. (Jed H. Horowitz, MD, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction can be performed awake with local anesthesia in the office or asleep in the surgery center. Whichever way you have it done you can expect a couple days of generalized soreness and discomfort. I typically perform liposculpture on Thursdays or Fridays and most return back to work on Monday.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4933" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>You are ok to resume all your normal day-to-day activities after a couple days with the exception of high impact activities. High impact activities such as running or crossfit should be held for the first 2 weeks to allowing smooth healing.</p><p>You will be given a compression garment which you will wear under your clothing for the first month. (Tyler Angelos, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Everyone has a different pain tolerance on average most of our patients are usually back to work in 1 week after Liposculpture. The first 3 days are always the hardest since your body is extremely sore and swollen.</p><p>It can also depend on the areas you had done, and the type of job you have. Some of our patients that have an office job and had their core done sometimes go back to work in 4-7 days.</p><p>Keep in mind you will still be sore, as long as your job is not too physical a week should be a good time frame. Ultimately its all based on how your body recovers, if you know you don’t have a high pain tolerance you might consider taking more time off. (Paul C. Dillon, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Recovery time after Liposculpture</h4><p>This depends partially on how much liposculpture is performed and to how many areas – the more liposculpture, the longer the recovery. The majority of my patients have liposculpture performed as day surgery. They go home wearing compression garments which they wear day and night for the first few days.</p><p>Patients are given strong pain killers, as there can be some discomfort when the local anaesthetic in the “wetting solution” wear off. I advise my patients to aim for around a week off work (although if only a few small areas are treated, some patients return to work much faster).</p><p>No exercise for 2 – 3 weeks. Patients can shower from the day after surgery. (Damian Marucci, MBBS, PhD, FRACS, Sydney Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Recovery after Liposculpture depends on many factors like number of areas treated, primary or redo, your skin elasticity and other physiological parameter like you baseline hemoglobin. If a single area like lateral thigh is treated you should be able to get back to routine activities in 5 to 7 days at the max.</p><p>However you may have bruise, swelling and numbness for two to three weeks. If multiple areas are done at the same time you are likely to be sore and may experience a sense of weakness (especially if Hb is low) for two to three weeks. (Jayanthy Ravindran, MS, DNB, MRCS, India Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It all really depends on the development of each patient. The first few days are the hardest but with the proper medications you will be fine. I usually recommend my patients two weeks to go back to their daily routines.</p><p>You should also have in mind that swelling can take up more time to go down but using your compression garment you will do just fine.
