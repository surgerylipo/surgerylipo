</div><h3>ANATOMICAL NUANCES OF FATTY DEPOSITS</h3><p>And although because of the excessive amount of fat, many girls are so unhappy with their body, without it people could not survive.</p><p>After all, fats are not only a source of energy, but also play a big role in maintaining the hormonal background of a woman. They also perform the functions of thermoregulation and the preservation of heat in the body.</p><p>Fatty food, having got into the mouth, already there begins to be split under the influence of saliva.</p><p>But in the stomach fat is not digested, entering the intestine almost unchanged. From there, it absorbs into the blood. Splits fats produced by the human body bile. Further, they either accumulate or are output. This happens depending on the amount of low and high density lipoproteins – proteins responsible for the content and transport of cholesterol in the blood.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_11990" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>If a person consumes more fat than the body needs, then they accumulate in fatty tissues with the help of an enzyme called lipase. Fat cells can stretch to huge sizes, containing a large amount of excess deposits.</p><p>As a result, weight gain occurs.</p><p>If you do not take any action, then the number of cells starts to grow, and the body becomes more and more overweight. The most interesting thing is that you can not destroy them. By diet, heavy workouts and other actions, you can simply split the fat. But as soon as all efforts stop, the person will recover again. How soon will the weight gain again, depends on a variety of reasons, but the main one is a hereditary predisposition.</p><p>INDICATIONS</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_11991" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>Liposuction, or, as experts say, liposculpture of lower legs is the surgical or non-surgical removal of excess fatty deposits, which is carried out according to the following indications:</p><ul>
<li>violation of body contours;</li>
<li>fatty folds on the back of the thighs;</li>
<li>bump on the inner side of the knee;</li>
<li>presence of fatty deposits on the entire surface of the thighs;</li>
<li>“Breeches” of the inner thigh;</li>
<li>massive disproportionate knees with overhanging folds;</li>
<li>sagging of tissues in the region of the hips, groin and under the buttocks;</li>
<li>dissatisfaction with leg proportions.</li>
</ul><p>Liposuction can be performed in conjunction with other types of surgical intervention. For example, simultaneously with excision of benign tumors in adipose tissue, rejuvenating procedures, lifting and removing excess sagging skin or muscles.</p><p>CONTRAINDICATIONS</p><p>Thighs correction with liposuction is contraindicated:</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_11992" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>To assess the result, the photo of the legs is taken before and after the procedure.</p><p>Lower leg liposuction, which is performed by the method of ultrasound treatment of adipose tissue, is of two types:</p><p>non-operative or cavitation – using a device that generates ultrasonic waves, there is a powerful massage of fat cells. In their cavity, bubbles are formed, filled with air, which burst from excessive stress. After the course of procedures (from 7 sessions, each for 50 minutes), fat gradually in the period up to three months is removed from the body. This method does not require incisions or puncturing, so it is the least traumatic; surgical intervention occurs by incisions in the necessary and marked places in advance, introducing an ultrasound probe into them. Fat under the influence of the device takes the form of a liquid emulsion, which is extracted under vacuum.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_11995" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>There is laser liposuction. In the right areas are introduced a special solution, which helps to thin the fat. Surplus is sucked off by the vacuum device through microscopic punctures with the help of a cannula – special needles, and the skin on the inside is exposed to the laser beam. Thus, its surface is leveled from the inside by heating. After the procedure, the skin becomes more taut and smooth. As a result, not only fat deposits leave the legs, but the covers look more aesthetic, their outlines do not slacken, their contours are smoothed out.</p><p>Other methods of liposuction also involve pumping the softened fat through the cannula after cell destruction, which is accomplished by one of the following methods:</p><ul>
<li>translational and fan-shaped movements of needles;</li>
<li>adrenaline and lidocaine mixed with an isotonic solution (tumescent anesthesia or Klein solution) under the skin;</li>
<li>by cooling to low temperatures;</li>
