<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Liposuction is used to contour your body and not act as a tool to lose weight. The best results from lipocution are usually seen when the patient is already at or close to their ideal body weight.</p><p>However, once a patient’s contours have improved significantly they are often motivated to lose additional weight so in that context liposuction does contribute to weight loss. (Jeffrey Weinzweig, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction works best on patients who are of relatively average weight, but who need help with a problem area, or with shedding the ten to twenty pounds they regain between diets.</p><p>Liposuction modifies volume by sucking out fat, and liposuction candidates need good skin tone.</p><p>Because liposuction stimulates the skin to tighten, good elasticity provides a smooth contour after fat is removed. Many times, liposuction of one area provides a good jump start for further dieting and exercise, allowing you to continue to lose weight.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4122" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p><i>Liposuction is for sculpting, not weight loss</i></p><p>Liposuction is a highly effective tool for targeted removal of fat from, waistline, tummy, back, thighs, and elsewhere. It is not, however, a method of losing weight. The maximum amount of fat that can be safely removed in a single session of liposuction is 5 liters – around 10 lbs.</p><p>It is important to remember, however, that this is from very specific areas, and very different from losing the same amount from the body as a whole, via diet and exercise. While the number on the scale may not change so much, beautiful sculpting of the areas treated can be expected. (Joshua D. Zuckerman, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Liposuction for appearance, not weight</b></p><p>Liposuction will not decrease your weight significantly, and you’ll be sorely disappointed if that is your expectation of the surgery. Liposuction is more about how you look. It can give you a leaner stomach and thighs, which can improve your appearance. (Ronald Levine, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4124" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Liposuction won’t help you lose 20 pounds, as the amount you will lose will just be a couple of pounds at most. Liposuction is just to recontour the body, not to make you lose weight. You’ll look better, but you won’t see a significant different on the scale. (Michael Constantin Gartner, DO, Paramus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction is not a weight loss method. It is a body contouring procedure. It works best for patients who have localized areas of fat that can be improved upon with liposuction. Some patients will see a small amount of weight loss but it is not normally more than 5-7 pounds. (Christopher J. Morea, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Liposuction and Weight Loss</i></p><p>Liposuction is not recommended or designed as a weight loss treatment. Liposuction effects the volume of the areas being treated and helps to contour problem areas of the body. Weight loss after liposuction will improve your results, but liposuction should not be thought of as a weight loss alternative.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4125" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-1d6c133d364c203e441159c1b0da3102">

</div><p>It is recommended that you be at a stable weight prior to your surgery for optimal and lasting results. (Jeffrey W. Hall, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Liposuction is Not a Weight Loss Procedure; It Is Performed to Fix Localized Fat Deposits </i></p><p>Liposuction is not a weight loss procedure. The procedure is performed to fix localized fat deposits which adversely impact body contour. These fat collections may be located in a variety of locations including the abdomen, hips, thighs, flanks and arms to name a few.</p><p>In many cases these areas don’t respond to diet and exercise. When liposuction is performed, it’s unusual for this procedure to result in weight loss greater than one or two lbs. Despite this, even when patients are twenty lbs overweight, liposuction can result in improved body contour and high satisfaction rates.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4126" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-34995e66c422e6d315276f7e9f6196f4">

</div><p>When weight loss is the primary goal, a weight loss program would be appropriate. Consultation with a board certified plastic surgeon would be a helpful first step. This consultation, would look at all the options and determine which one is best for you. (Richard J. Bruneteau, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction is more about sculpting and is not designed to help with weight loss. Even with 5 liters of liposuction, patients will only lose a few pounds. Therefore, you will not lose the 20 lbs, but your shape will be much better. (Daniel Reichner, MD, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction removes localized excess fat fairly well. Patients look better because of how it changes the contour of the treated areas. Fat is bulky, but not very dense. Therefore, small changes in body weight occur when liposuction is done.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4127" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Liposuction really won’t help you loose much weight. Don’t do it for weight loss. (Sutton Graham II, MD, Greenville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Liposuction is a contouring procedure</strong></p><p>I would not look at weight to determine if you are a candidate for liposuction. In fact, I would not even think of liposuction since that is just a tool we have for removing fat.</p><p>First, I would have you look at your lifestyle (i.e. diet, exercise, habits, , etc.). You should optimize your lifestyle as much as possible. Each person will have a different body contour at their ideal healthy and stable lifestyle.</p><p>Then you can look at specific body features and determine what if anything you would like to change. A plastic surgeon can then determine the appropriate surgeries to achieve your goals. However, look at these procedures as contouring procedures, not weight reduction procedures.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4128" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Your weight could even go up after liposuction, but hopefully your contouring will be more agreeable. As far as liposuction is concerned, the more fit you are, the more compact and limited the fat deposits, and the more accurate and safe the liposuction is. (Robin T.W. Yuan, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Liposuction is not about weight reduction, but sculpting</h3><p>What you weigh boils down to two things that are hard to control: How much you eat and how much you metabolize. Change either of these things and you change how much fat is on your body.</p><p>Unfortunately, what happens to most of us is we eat too much and don’t exercise enough. The result is unwanted weight gain. Liposuction does absolutely nothing about this equation. Unless you change what you eat or the amount of exercise you do, you will regain every ounce of fat that was removed by the liposuction.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4129" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>So here is the key. Liposuction is great for localized unwanted areas of fat like saddle bags, stomach, inner thighs, etc. While you will later regain the fat that was removed (unless you eat less or exercise more), the effect of liposuction on body contour will be relatively lasting because the localized fat deposits will be permanently improved relative to the rest of the body.</p><p>The fat you regain will be more evenly distributed over the entire body. The take home less is liposuction is for body sculpting not weight reduction. Having said that, sometimes the improved body contour inspires people to increase their workout or reduce their caloric intake. (Kenneth D. Steinsapir, MD, Beverly Hills Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h3>If you are happy with your figure, DON’T have liposuction.</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4130" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Of course you remove a few pounds with liposuction. But this is incidental. The purpose of liposuction is to remove bulges and improve contour. You need to slowly and gradually reduce your caloric intake (diets don’t work; small portions of leafy vegetables are the key), and you need at least 4 hours of aerobic (sweating) exercise a week. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Liposuction is not a weight loss procedure</h4><p>Liposuction is not a weight loss procedure. If you expect to come out from surgery 20 lbs lighter, then you will be disappointed. Liposuction is used as a body contouring procedure to hit areas that one has not been able to work on with diet and exercise.</p><p>Ideally, Liposuction should be performed on patients at their ideal body weight or close to it. (Farbod Esmailian, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Liposuction is about shaping and contouring</strong></p><p>Like Michelangelo’s sculpture, David, liposuction is all about the shape and contour you leave behind. 500 years later, skilled plastic surgeons understand this (see these other excellent replies). We’re just trying to end up with a good shape, and aren’t too worried about how much the marble on the floor weighs.</p><p>While you MIGHT see your weight change later, the priority and only reasonable expectation is to have the contour improve. It is a sculpting procedure, not a means to achieve weight loss. (Brian K. Brzowski, MD, FACS, Ogden Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The proper patient for liposuction has done all they can with diet and exercise, has goone skin elasticity and a few very specific areas of fat excess that are resistent. It is for contouring of these areas and not for any significant amount of weight loss.</p><p>20 pounds is within your reach, just re-evaluate what you are eating and step up the exercise a little bit. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction is great for body sculpturing. Removal of fat from areas like the hips ,flanks etc.. Liposuction should not be used to loose weight. The society recommendation is to stay within 5 liters of lipoaspirate.</p><p>Together with using a tumescent technique ,this will keep you safe.
