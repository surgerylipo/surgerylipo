<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>With regard to liposuction alternatives such as cool sculpting, TruSculpt, Liposonix ,etc.. They are making headway in being able to slightly reduce the fat layer in the right candidate who is not open to the idea of surgery.</p><p>But, none will ever compare to the degree of improvement, and precision one can get from well-done liposculpture by the right surgeon. While I have chosen to incorporate Liposonix in my practice, as I feel it is the most effective nonsurgical option, it is reserved for patients who do not want surgery and accept a modest improvement.</p><p>But I always evaluate every patient myself to determine what is the best option and who is truly a candidate for what procedure….if any! liposculpture and nonsurgical alternatives should both be viewed as procedures to target disproportion.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_12049" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Neither are a substitute for weight loss or exercise. I have also incorporated Ultrashape in my practice and am a key opinion leader for the technology. It is very selective and painless and I am using it also in my revision work. (David Amron, MD, Beverly Hills Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Alternatives to Liposuction Include CoolSculpting, Endermologie and Zerona</h4><p>It’s not unusual to see patients who have significant body contour issues, who are reluctant to undergo liposuction. This reluctance occurs for a variety of reasons including surgical risks, pain, time off work and expense.</p><p>For these reasons, many patients are looking for non invasive low cost alternatives. There are several non surgical alternatives available for the treatment of localized fat accumulations.</p><p>These include Coolsculpting, Endermologie, and Zerona. Unfortunately, these techniques only remove small amounts of fat and therefore only give minimal amounts of improvement.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_12050" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>When patients have significant fat accumulation, the only technique that has been shown to be effective is liposuction. If you have localized fat accumulations this probably still represents your best alternative.</p><p>If your considering any type of body contouring its important to meet with a board certified plastic surgeon who has experience in this area.</p><p>In some cases of significant fat accumulation, where anxiety is present, its better to do nothing then spend money on a procedure that gives minimal results. (Richard J. Bruneteau, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There really is nothing that will approximate the results of liposuction. Here at my Cleveland plastic surgery practice, VASER liposuction has created incredible results for my patients.</p><p>Compared with the traditional tumescent procedure, there’s less blood loss, better skin tightening and faster healing, especially when combined with post-procedure massage on the treated areas.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_12051" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>While we all wish it were so, nothing non-surgical will give you the same results.</p><p>Believe me, we’d be delighted if that were so. (Paul Vanek, MD, Cleveland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction is a significant operation. It is expensive and the results are largely the result of the person who is utilizing the cannula. There is a lot of hype of the different technologies involved such as Ultrasonic (Vaser and Liposonix), Laser (Slim Lipo), Water Assisted, and power assisted.</p><p>At the end of the day, it all involves removing fat through small incisions that are placed in remote, easy to conceal locations. “Non-Surgical” methods to decrease fat deposits can range from mesotherapy injections (not fda approved), fat freezing (coolsculpt) or transcutaneous ultrasonic energy (vaser shape)</p><p>The last two options cause damage to fat cells and rely on the body to reabsorb the damaged fat which in theory debulks the area and then the skin is supposed to shrink over this.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_12052" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>It is a mistake to compare one versus the other for generalized debulking and recontouring. There could be a role for the non surgical methods (excluding mesotherapy), but in terms of getting predictable results, liposuction (whatever method) tends to give the most predictable results for body contouring.</p><p>As far as expense goes, if you price out any of the new technologies, you will end up paying close to the same price as you would for standard liposuction for a result that may not meet your expectations.</p><p>If you are at your ideal body weight and have a very localized area of fat that you want to treat, then the noninvasive techniques may be worth your while. If you are like the other 99.9% of patients, liposuction would be the better option. (Stephen M. Chen, MD, Richmond Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_12053" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h3>CoolSculpting as a Liposuction Alternative</h3><p>CoolSculpting is a treatment that can provide wonderful results for the appropriate candidate. But, it in no way eliminates the need for liposuction, not is it an ideal treatment for all people. You may wish to get a consultation from a plastic surgeon in your area offering both liposuction and CoolSculpting so you will get the best advice about which treatment will provide the desired results for you. (Michael Law, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>LIposuction alternatives</strong></p><p>Although I am a board certified Plastic Surgeon, I have spent most of my career exploring alternative technology, serving on the board and serving as President of ASLMS.</p><p>I continue to serve on many advisory boards that bring new lasers and new technology to market.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_12054" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I also continue to speak all over the world on these topics. I do not say this to boast in any way but to simply give you a background for my upcoming comments. When you say you are not interested in liposuction, I respect that, but just know that you are saying that you are not interested in the most effective and predictable medical or surgical treatment to improve body contour and remove unwanted fat.</p><p>What you are saying is that you want something easier and I can guarantee you that easier means less predictable and less effective. However, many people opt for that choice and I have spent a career exploring these options.</p><p>I have experience with the leading alternatives to liposuction. The best non invasive options include Coolsculpting which freezes fat bulges and LIposonix which is High frequency Ultrasound which heats and melts fat. They both work but to a less effective and less predictable degree than liposuction.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_12055" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Laser liposuction, is dependent more on the surgeon performing the procedure than the laser itself. It can be effective and may have some advantages in skin tightening but that is yet to be proven conclusively.</p><p>If laser liposuction removes as much fat as traditional tumescent liposuction, I believe the recovery, risks, and benefits are very similar. There are many alternatives to liposuction, but the pros and cons of each should be discussed in person after a complete exam to determine which, if any of these options are right for you. (Jay Burns, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There are always at least 2 solid alternatives to liposuction:</p><ol>
<li>exercise and diet</li>
<li>do nothing</li>
</ol><p>In each case you will save yourself the money, pain and recovery. (Ellen A. Mahony, MD, Westport Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_12056" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>There are many non-invasive techniques to reduce fat. Most of these techniques do NOT work at all and those that do only have very minimal results. These techniques may be beneficial for those people who want to lose a tiny amount of fat.</p><p>There are no real good alternative other than diet and exercise to the results of invasive traditional liposuction. (Robert Heck, MD, FACS, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction is indicated for removal of excess fatty deposits in the body. It is not to be used as a weight loss tool. The alternatives would be to exercise and eat healthy and try to lose down to ideal weight; however, there are usually some fatty deposits that remain after obtaining ideal body weight. These will respond best to liposuction. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Unfortunately, there are no true liposuction alternatives. There are options coming forth with freezing and ultrasonic fat removal/reduction that work in very small, incremental ways. There are no true non-surgical options that are successful in taking the place of liposuction at this time. (Rod J. Rohrich, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>If you are not overweight, younger than 40 years, physically fit and interested in body countouring, external ultrasound and tumescent ( infiltration of fluid beneath your skin ) would be an accepbale alternative. Otherwise LIPOSELECTION or VASER is more cost effective in experienced hands. Side effects are rare and most of my patients are gratified with using ultrasonic liposuction technics. (Fereydoon S. Mahjouri, MD, Minneapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction is probably the best method for permanently getting rid of unwanted fat. By suctioning out the fat cells you eliminate them altogether. Modalities such as endermologie or Velashape simply massage the fat but do not eliminate it.</p><p>Various cellulite creams may work to some degree while you use the cream but the problem returns once you stop. For awhile, there was some interest in injecting various substances which supposedly “dissolved” fat. There was no particular formula used, however, and some questionable materials were being used.</p><p>Also, many patients reported lumpiness in the treated areas because the material was not being dispersed evenly. Yes, there is a little more down time and a little more money involved in doing liposuction but it can be done through very small incisions and the results are consistently better than with other modalities. (Edwin C. Pound, III, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>For the right candidates, a nonsurgical fat reduction procedure can produce good results. However, for heavier patients or patients with loose skin, liposuction either in isolation or in combination with abdominoplasty may be advised. Consult with an experienced and expert board certified plastic surgeon to understand your options. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
