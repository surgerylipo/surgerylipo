</div><p>Remember that as you age your metabolism slows, so you have to eat less and exercise more to stay the same weight as previously. Liposuction will improve your contours and proportions, but will not stop your body from accumulating fat overall.</p><p>I recommend reviewing your diet and exercise habits in order to get the most out of your surgery. (Larry S. Nichter, MD, MS, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction is a contouring procedure not a weight loss instrument. That being said, some patients will lose a tremendous amount of fat and thus will weigh less. After a few months swelling has been reduced and you should not be gaining any weight unless you have given up exercise or overeating.

</div><p>The way to look at liposuction is really a sculpting procedure that is suppose to improve those fat deposits that have been resistant to exercise.</p><p>It is a great procedure and produces wonderful results, and helps patients extenuate their curves. Nevertheless, the reality is that the remaining fat cells will still gain weight if we do not choose to make a strong committment to a lifestyle modification.</p><p>When the healing period is over and you have realized the newly improved contour, that is the time to go that extra step and use this boost of self esteem. Exercise regularly and eat healthy.</p><p>I know that the are a lot of fade diets out there, but nothing works better than good old fashion regular exercise and a balanced diet. I advise everyone that has felt frustrated with weight gain to seek the help of a nutritionist to help guide them in the correct path to a healthier diet.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5381" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>It is not a free pass to eat more. To begin with, many people, both men and woman, gain weight year after year after their active years, and liposuction may be a disincentive to keep the weight off.</p><p>Liposuction works and it doesn’t affect your appetite, but it may affect your mental attitude, and you may feel more free to eat more, eat less healthfully and exercise less. I have had many patients through the years tell me that they heard that if you suction fat out of one area, it goes to another area.</p><p>I would like to clear this up as well. When the fat is removed from one area via liposuction, it is gone — in the bucket. If you maintain the same weight, the fat will not “migrate” elsewhere.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5383" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-2e919f2fd429e57e6b696af7dc1bd7e4">

</div><p>When one gains weight, it must go somewhere. It may be less likely to go to the area that was liposuctions, however. I have known people who have a liposuction every couple of years because they are less disciplined about their dietary habits.</p><p>One exception makes it more difficult for most people and that is menapause or andropause. When the sex hormone diminish, muscles atrophy and the fat accumulates. For this condition, which everyone eventually goes through, I highly recommend seeking a specialist in bioidentical hormone therapy.</p><p>Proper treatment and hormone balance can make an enormous difference. Finally, excess weight gain is not healthy for you. The formula is simple. Eat 5-6 servings of vegetables a day even if they are small.</p><p>Make sure you eat many different colors of vegetables as the pigments are nutrinets. Fruit can be substituted for a vegetable or added. This should make up 2/3 of your plate. The other 1/3 should be lean meat, fish or protein of some sort.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5384" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-c5d301752138ce68913e896767e4d68f">

</div><p>Note that there are no simple carbohydrates in the formula. Grass fed meats and non-farmed fish are healthier for you. My suggestion is to keep a notebook of your daily diet and this will tell the story.</p><p>Liposuction is a terrific operation with minimal risk, but it is not a substitute for diligence toward good health. (E. Ronald Finger, MD, Savannah Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I don’t know of any good metabolic reason that you would be gaining weight after liposuction. I would rather think it is related to the normal metabolic changes associated with getting older or possibly you relaxed your diet / exercise regime a bit after the surgery.</p><p>One thing I am certain of it that weight change will negatively impact the results of your liposuction surgery. I would suggest increasing your exercise program and monitoring your diet. (Michael A. Bogdan, MD, FACS, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Stopped exercising or any regular physical activity leads to Weight Gain after Liposuction</em></p><p>Have you stopped exercising or any regular physical activity thinking that Liposuction has solved any weight problems you may have experienced? Depending on how much fat was removed, and which areas. Start exercicing again and control your weight regularly under a doctor’s supervision. (Alberto Di Giuseppe, MBBS, London Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Weight Gain after Liposuction?</em></p><p>Weight gain is related to an imbalance between caloric intake and calories burned, unless there is a medical reason (such as hypothyroidism or diabetes) to explain the weight gain. The liposuction procedure itself cannot be blamed.(Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Change in Metabolism and Habits</h5><p>it is not unusal to see people gain weight after liposuction. This is usually because once they lose the excess fat, they let their guard down and don’t watch their diet. At times, changes in metabolism with aging also contributes to this weight gain.</p><p>Some doctors believe that after weight loss by liposuction body tries to conserve energy and fat. At that point the best way to maintain weight is to increase your metabolism by increasing your activity level. (Sean Younai, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Get back to the gym after liposuction</b></p><p>Weight gain after liposuction is not uncommon during the initial post-op period. However, by one year, you should not be having this problem unless you are eating excessively and/or not exercising. It is really simple math: too much in and not enough exercise to match those extra calories will lead to increase weight. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction is targeted and permanent removal of fat cells. Once those fat cells are removed they do not grow back. That is not to say that after someone receives liposuction they cannot gain weight or have the area that was improved by lipo get worse.</p><p>There is no connection from a physiologic standpoint between the removal of fat cells and weight gain a year later. What is more likely is that the weight gain is because of the things that cause all of us to gain weight: Not enough exercise Too much stress Not eating well In more rare cases, there can be medical reasons for people to gain weight.</p><p>Unfortunately there’s no easy answer to weight gain. (Steven H. Williams, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Weight Fluctuations after Liposuction</strong></p><p>Initially liposuction takes away fat and then you have some swelling and fluid in the areas that were suctioned. After a few months a patient may notice a loss of weight but some notice an increase in weight.</p><p>Studies have shown that just as regular weight loss patients must eat healthy and exercise to maintain a desired weight loss so must postop liposuction patients. Usually there is some soreness and restriction of activity after liposuction and that adds to the problem of weight gain.</p><p>Exercise as tolerated once allowed is good for this weight gain. Restriction of salt containing foods also will aid in maintaining one’s desired weight. Liposuction is not a weight loss tool. It always comes down to healthy nutritional intake and a routine of consistent exercise (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Output Must Equal Intake</h3><p>There is a very simple relationship that describes metabolic equilibrium regarding body weight: Caloric Output must equal Caloric Intake.</p><ul>
<li>Greater Caloric Intake than Caloric Expenditure = Weight Gain</li>
<li>Greater Caloric Expenditure than Caloric Intake = Weight Loss</li>
</ul><p>Liposuction does not alter the equation in any way whatsoever.</p><p>It is simply a method of improving the cosmetic contours of the body silhouette. Patients often think they have good eating habits, only to find that they gain weight after Liposuction. The reason may not be limited to poor eating habits alone, but may also involve lack of sufficient exercise.</p><p>A consultation with a nutritionist to analyze your eating habits, as well as a regimen of exercise supervised by a personal trainer, may put you back on the proper track to maintaining the improvements your achieved with your Liposuction procedure. (Athleo Louis Cambre, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Gaining a few pounds immediately after liposuction is common. However, after a year post surgery this is not something I would consider common. Be sure to maintain a healthy lifestyle, exercising and eating a healthy diet in order to maintain the best results. (Jaime Perez, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There is no reason that you would gain weight after liposuction that is related to the procedure itself. (Leo Keegan, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Unexplained weight gain without an identifiable increase in caloric intake should prompt a consultation with a medical weight loss specialist who can organize a proper diet and exercise regimen. (Raffy Karamanoukian, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You can certainly gain or lose weight following liposuction. However neither is directly related to the surgery. There must be some other reason ( metabolic, increased caloric intake, lack of exercise). The thing that you should notice is a more evenly distribution of the weight gain rather than localizing more in the area or areas treated with liposuction. (John Whitt, MD (retired), Louisville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>The key is increasing your exercising.</b></p><p>Your weight gain has nothing to do with your liposuction a year ago. You may be eating normal but your metabolism is evidently slowing down. The best way to increase your metabolism is by regular exercising.</p><p>Give this a try for several months. An alternative to increase your metabolism (only after you have tried to increase your exercising for months and reached a plateau) is with phentermine pills which your doc can prescribe.</p><p>Some times a little help goes a long way. Having a supportive spouse or friend to exercise with and discuss dieting habits with or just encouragement and praise is also helpful. Eating 5 small meals a day instead of 3 medium-big meals helps curb binge eating and suppresses appetites also. (David Hansen, MD, Beverly Hills Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>If Liposuction or Liposelection ( Ultrasonic/Vaser) is done to address undesireable deposited fat which is resistant to diet and exercise, patienr would look more shaped and sligthly ligther. It takes 2-3 months to appreciate the results.</p><p>Gaining weight is not by any means related or connected to liposuction. Occasinally some patients change their life style by stop dieting and exercising hoping that they will not gain weight after liposuction which is an unrealistic expectation. (Fereydoon S. Mahjouri, MD, Minneapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
