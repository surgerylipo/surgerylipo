<li>The surgeon is difficult to work because the injected solution deforms the contours of the body and does not allow you to accurately determine whether you need to remove more fat, or already enough;</li>
<li>the possible development of such a complication as tuberosity or unevenness of the skin over those areas where the fatty tissue was removed unevenly;</li>
<li>the presence of epinephrine or adrenaline (narrows the blood vessels) in the solution can lead to undesirable consequences for the patient’s health.</li>
</ul><h4>Damaged blood vessels and nerves</h4><p>When aqualipo is performed, it is impossible to damage large vessels, but medium and small vessels are often damaged and, in aggregate, can lead to significant bleeding. Also, small nerve trunks are often damaged, which are responsible for the sensitivity of the skin.</p><h4>Degree of traumatization of tissues</h4><p>Practically in any of the methods, the doctor has to make considerable efforts to break the fat deposits by the forward movements of the cannula. This causes significant tissue damage, and also leads to rupture of vessels and nerves much more often. Such physical influences as ultrasound or laser can damage not only the fat tissue that is being removed, but also the skin and deeper structures such as the fascia, tendons, muscles, which can lead to proliferation of connective tissue.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6324" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><h3>Inability of adipose tissue for transplantation</h3><p>Now very few people go only to aqualipo. Most often, simultaneously with the removal of unwanted fat, it is transplanted to places where fat is not enough. Most often it is the area of the mammary glands.</p><p>In order for the volume of body parts enlarged by transplantation of adipose tissue to be preserved, it is necessary to transplant living cells. Most of the techniques do not allow the extraction of fully viable fatty tissue, because surgeons resort to using a variety of techniques to separate living fat cells from damaged ones.</p><h3>A large number of complications</h3><p>Despite the apparent simplicity of the liposuction operation, serious complications up to a lethal outcome are not uncommon. Frequent in patients after liposuction are anemia, impaired skin sensitivity, development of skin pigmentation at the site of the procedure, thrombosis, fat embolism and others.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6325" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><h4>The inability to immediately remove a large amount of fat</h4><p>Naturally, women and men who decide on liposuction often want to improve the appearance of several areas of the body, for example, the abdomen, sides, lower back, hips and the area around the knee joints. Earlier it was possible to conduct liposuction in only a few visits. And this means, each time anesthesia, and every time a recovery period.</p><h4>Why was the method of water-jet liposuction created?</h4><p>All of the above spodviglo developers of the corporation HumanMed AG to create a method of liposuction, which would expand the possibilities of plastic surgeon and was less traumatic for the patient.</p><p>Also called the device, which was designed to conduct Body Jet liposuction. In Europe, the use of the company’s devices began in 2004.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6326" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><h4>What are the features of the method?</h4><p>The procedure combines all the advantages of dry and moist methods of pumping fat. On the one hand, solutions are not introduced into the tissue, therefore all body contours are preserved and the result of the procedure can be evaluated immediately.</p><p>On the other hand, the use of a fluid jet that disconnects fat cells facilitates the advancement of the cannula and allows the surgeon to exert no effort. </p><p>Cannula apparatus Body Jet have two lumens. One fluid is supplied under pressure, and through the second, the liquid is sucked along with the fat cells.</p><p>This method of separation and removal of adipose tissue is more gentle for vessels and nerves, which are much more resilient and not damaged by water jet.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6327" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><h3>ADVANTAGES</h3><p>The work of the surgeon is much easier, which now can work with jewelry accuracy. Surgeon can control the result of each of the stages of the operation visually, since nothing changes the contours of the body.</p><p>This means that there is no risk of detecting untreated areas or areas where the adipose tissue has been removed unevenly after surgery.</p><p>The patient’s body tissues are much less injured. Method developers are advised to perform the operation under local anesthesia, it is so easily tolerated by the patient. </p><p>Therefore, the state of health after the operation is better, and the recovery period is shorter. Surgeon can remove up to 1.59 gal of fat at a time.</p><p>Usually, no more than 0.79 gal can be removed by other methods at a time. This restriction is associated with significant tissue trauma and vascular damage. The smaller the degree of damage, the more fat can be removed.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6328" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><strong>Excellent opportunities for lipofilling.</strong></p><p>The fat cells are separated by the pressure of water and then vacuumed off in a disposable sterile package so that they do not come in contact with the air. No more manipulation of the fatty tissue in order to prepare it for a transplant is not carried out. This means that the cells are not damaged by the manipulations performed with them and are not oxidized by air oxygen. Accordingly, their survival is much better.</p><h3>INDICATIONS FOR Aqualipo</h3><ul>
<li>The appearance of fat deposits, which spoil the body lines, make them fuzzy, blurred.</li>
<li>It can be the abdomen, sides, outer and inner thighs, areas above the knee joints, outer surfaces of the shins, hands, neck.</li>
<li>A prerequisite for the appointment of liposuction is the preserved skin tone. If the elasticity of the skin is reduced, then it is advisable to combine aqualipo with a surgical skin tightening.</li>

</div><h3>Contraindications to surgery</h3><ul>
<li>Unstable body weight.</li>
<li>The fact that the volume will return in multiple sizes is a myth. Just like the fact that the number of fat cells is restored. Those areas of the body that have undergone Aqualipo, will be slower to gain volume in the event that a person gaining weight. And this can lead to the appearance of unnatural outlines of the body.</li>
<li>Pregnancy. Usually, during the operation, in the preparatory and postoperative period, the patient is prescribed a large number of medications that can adversely affect the fetus.</li>
<li>Breastfeeding period.</li>
<li>Severe somatic diseases, which lead to impaired functions of the organs (cardiac, hepatic, renal failure and so on);</li>
<li>Polyvalent allergy.</li>
<li>Diabetes.</li>
<li>Infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, viral hepatitis, syphilis, colds.</li>
<li>Instability of emotional background.</li>
<li>Menstruation.</li>
<li>Mental diseases.</li>
<li>Oncology.</li>
<li>Age to 18 years.</li>
<li>Significant degree of obesity.</li>
</ul><h3>Preparation for surgery</h3><p>Preparation for the operation involves consultations, a series of examinations and compliance with the recommendations and limitations of the doctor, which are designed to reduce the risk of complications of the operation.</p><h3>Consultations:</h3><ul>
<li>the operating surgeon (determines the presence of indications for the operation, the volume of the operation, explains the possible outcomes and consequences of the operation);</li>
<li>therapist (determines the presence of contraindications to the operation);</li>
<li>anesthesiologist (determines the presence of contraindications to anesthesia).</li>

</ul><h3>How to prepare for the procedure?</h3><p>Then the patient is invited to the operating room and placed on the operating table. While an anesthesiologist injects drugs for anesthesia, the surgeon treats the area of operation with solutions of antiseptics. Depending on the area in which fat is removed, and the thickness of the fatty tissue layer, cannulas of different diameters can be used, which can be from 3.8 to 4.3 mm in thickness. The thicker the cannula, the better its performance.</p><p>Cannulas are introduced through small punctures or skin incisions, which are most often performed in natural folds of the body. When the fat removal is finished, the cannula is removed, seams and sterile dressings are applied to the skin incisions.</p><p>Already in the operating room, the patient wears compression underwear.</p><h3>Recovery period</h3><p>The first day should be done in the clinic. This is due not so much to the complexity of the liposuction as to the anesthesia performed. After the operation, you just need to take 3-4 days of vacation or sick leave just in case, so that the body can recover. After a maximum of a week, you can safely go to work. Wearing compression underwear should be from 2 to 4 weeks, depending on the recommendations of the plastic surgeon. In the first 2-3 weeks should follow the recommendations that are aimed at accelerating the resorption of edema and hematomas:</p><ol>
<li>refusal of thermal procedures (sauna, solarium, hot bath);</li>
<li>Do not massage the skin in the area of the operation;</li>
<li>limit physical activity and to postpone a visit to the gym;</li>
<li>wear a compression garment.</li>
</ol><p>Starting with the third or fourth week, you can begin procedures that will help improve skin tone:</p><ul>
<li>lymphatic drainage massage;</li>
<li>masks and wraps;</li>
<li>LPG massage and other procedures.</li>
<li>Sutures are removed for 7-10 days. Before that, they must be treated with solutions of antiseptics.</li>
</ul><h4>POSSIBLE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF Aqualipo</h4><p>The discrepancy between the expected result and the result. This is due to the presence of a large number of myths and misconceptions, under the influence of which the patients form high expectations.</p><p></p>

</div>In fact:
<ul>
<li>with liposuction you can not lose weight, you can only improve the contours of the body;</li>
<li>Aqua Liposuction does not replace proper nutrition and regular exercise;</li>
<li>Liposuction can not relieve obesity and is not carried out with obesity;</li>
<li>Aqualipo can not get rid of stretch marks and flabbiness of the skin.</li>
<li>The presence of persistent hematomas and edema.</li>
<li>There are hematomas after aqualipo also happen. Usually they disappear within the first week after the operation. Swelling goes slower.</li>
<li>Development of hematomas and seroma. It happens that in the cavities that are formed on the site of the removed adipose tissue, blood or tissue fluid accumulates. Such cavities need to be drained. A good preventive tool in this case is compression underwear.</li>
<li>Development of inflammation.</li>
<li>Thrombosis and thromboembolism.</li>
<li>Development of small adhesions at the site of Aqualipo.</li>
</ul><p>Usually hospitalization is prescribed on the day of surgery. In the preoperative on the patient’s body in the standing position, markings are applied. Specially mark those zones that require increased attention.</p></div>
