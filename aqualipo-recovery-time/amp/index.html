</div><p><strong>Aqualipo Recovery depends on 3 things</strong>: A small area under the chin or in the lower stomach will take much less time than full-body lipo. Returning to a desk job will take much less time than Active Duty Military or returning to the gym or aerobics.</p><p>Your overall health and fitness will contribute to how fast you bounce back as well. (Kevin Dieffenbach, MD, Oahu Island Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>When will it all end?</i></p><p>Although recovering from Aqualipo can be, for some, like an eternity, most surgeons measure results as final by 6 months. At that point, irregularities and asymmetries are striking and are probably not going to change and may deserve revision. (Marshall T. Partington, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>With liposuction, my patients are up and moving that night with the ability of easing back into normal daily activities within the first week. You are absolutely able to have this procedure done on a Thursday or Friday and return to work that following Monday as long as you are not involved in any vigorous activity that would elevate your heart rate or cause you to strain.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5869" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The key with liposuction recovery is allowing yourself down time to help reduce swelling. This does not mean you are on bed rest, rather I am request 10-14 days without vigorous exercise or activity. My patients will then start to ease back into their more vigorous routine around this time.</p><p>Aqualipo is a wonderful option for those little areas that are not responding to diet and exercise. (Ronald Downs, MD, FACS, South Bend Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It really depends on the volume that is removed. For large amounts most people take a week off but once the compression garment has been applied, which I prefer to place the day after surgery, then most feel good enough to start light exercise.</p><p>Returning to work depends on the amount of physical activity required in your work. Contours are best evaluated around 3 months. (Constance M. Barone, MD, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5870" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><i>Most people take about one week of downtime after liposuction.</i></p><p>The exact recovery process depends on how your body responds to the surgery and the extent of the treatment. Generally, most liposuction candidates take about one week away from work before returning to their normal routines.</p><p>You should continue to avoid strenuous activities for several weeks or more. However, it’s important to get into an exercise routine as soon as you feel recovered so that you can maintain your liposuction results with a healthy lifestyle. (Lee B. Daniel, MD, Eugene Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Recovery time for liposuction is usually 7 days. While swelling, bruising and numbness may be present for up to 3-6 months, patients may feel comfortable returning to work before 7 days if they have an administrative job. (Jeffrey Weinzweig, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5871" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Every patient’s recovery time is different, but most patients can go back to work within 2-3 days. Patients can be sore for up to 3 weeks after liposuction for the abdomen and longer for the limbs. (Hooman Khorasani, MD, New York Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Recovery varies from 7-14 days depending on the patient / procedure</i></p><p>This depends on the area being targeted, however, most patients will have about 1-2 weeks downtime (the more volume removed the long the recovery). It takes a 6 weeks for full recovery however improvements continue for months after liposuction as long as a healthy diet is maintained.</p><p>You should be able to return to work comfortably in 1-2 weeks. (Yannis Alexandrides, MD, London Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Aqualipo Recovery May Take Up to 4 Weeks</h5><p>Normally, after liposuction activity is determined by the patient’s comfort level. If a patient wanted to walk a mile the day after surgery it should not affect the outcome. Most patients however, will not want to do so because of the associated discomfort.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5872" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Downtime will also be determined by the particular areas treated, the number of areas treated, and the amount of fat removed. It is not unusual to still have a small amount of pain in the lower back area for up to four weeks after the procedure. (John J. Edney, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Aqualipo recovery and swelling – Los Angeles</h3><p>It varies from individual to individual. Most liposuction will take 6 months for the swelling to subside. Keep massaging and you may need Endermologie treatment. (Raffy Karamanoukian, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Liposuction Recovery Over in 2-4 Months</i></p><p>Aqualipo recovery varies from person to person, but generally swelling has fully subsided at 2-4 months. With some patients some temporary lumps and hardness can also occur but that should also be resolved by about the 3-4 month mark. (Jeffrey W. Hall, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Aqualipo recovery varies from patient to patient. I recommend patients to try lymphatic drainage massage to help with lumps, bumps and hardness. (Jaime Perez, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Lumps and Bumps post liposuction</strong></p><p>It can take 6 months or more for you to see the final results of your surgery and for full maturation of the scars, I would be somewhat concerned that at 4 months you are experiencing bulges and hardness.</p><p>If there has been slow, but definite improvement to date, then wait to allow further healing. But if it is stable you should have a visit with your surgeon to discuss these concerns and evaluate you and prepare for a “touch up” procedure or other alternative if necessary. (Theodore Katz, MD, FACS, Philadelphia Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>After 6 months, the majority of the skin tightening from scar healing has completed, and you should be able to assess your final result. In some cases, hardness can represent small “hematomas” or blood collections that hardened, and these can take longer to resolve (do you remember being really black and blue?) – up to a year. (Michael A. Bogdan, MD, FACS, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>After liposcution there is often residual swelling and bruising that persists for several weeks. The majority of swelling will go away fter 3-4 weeks but you may see residual swelling for several months afterwards, especially if you exert yourself significantly. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The stomach is the hardest area to get a perfectly smooth result after liposuction. I try very hard to prevent irregularities but still occasionally see them. We use a form of massage called lymphatic drainage massage for 2 or 3 weeks after liposuction of the stomach because we think this helps get a smooth result. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Swelling resolves art different rates for different patients</i></p><p>Healing is different for everyone. The more fat that is removed the longer it will take for the swelling to resolve. I tell my patients that swelling takes anywhere from 6 months to a year for the final results.</p><p>Your surgeon can examine the lumps and decide if they are the results of; Excess fat – for which revision should be scheduled. Seroma – a fluid collection under the skin that should have treated a long time ago.</p><p>Hematoma – blood under the skin, which also should have been treated a long time ago. Routine swelling- which can be treated with compression garments, massage, lymphatic drainage, Ultrasound treatments and the TOT (tincture of Time). (Robert M. Freund, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It may take 6 months or so for bumps and hardness to soften and flatten. For this reason, you can not critically evaluate results of a liposuction. Your surgeon should be able to give you some massage techniques or ultrasound treatments to resolve the lumps more quickly. (Kenneth R. Francis, MD, FACS, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>After Aqualipo, you will have swelling and occasionally “hardness” of the tissue (from lymphedema), but this progressively resolves.</p><p>Additionally, the swelling may worsen throughout the day while you are standing and improve overnight as you are sleeping. You should not have large lumps. Do the lumps feel like they have fluid in them? Occasionally, fluid will accumulate under the skin where the liposuction was performed.</p><p>If this occurs, you may need to have it drained in your surgeon’s office.
