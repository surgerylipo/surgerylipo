<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Liposuction is surgery to improve the contour of your body by removing excess fat from specific areas. “Lipo” comes from the greek word “lipos” meaning fat. Other names for liposuction commonly used by physicians are suction-assisted lipectomy (SAL), lipoplasty, and tumescent liposuction.</p><p>Tumescent liposuction refers to the injection of large volumes of fluid injected prior to the actual liposuction portion of the procedure.</p><p>When you hear the terms, SmartLipo, Cool-Lipo, and Slim-Lipo, these refer to laser liposuction where a laser is used to treat the fat and melt or dissolve the fat prior to it being suctioned out.</p><p>These techniques typically require only local sedation and offer quicker recovery due to less swelling or bruising.</p><p>The newest technology in liposuction is water assisted liposuction (WAL or Body-Jet). Body-Jet uses a pulsating stream of water to dislodge the fat while simultaneously suctioning the fat.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4918" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-c5a320fa69312d561fc6cd54de925dff">

</div><p>This results in much less swelling and bruising than with other techniques. Because there is less fluid introduced at one time, it also offers the surgeon greater control over the result.</p><p>Liposculpture was a term originally coined to differentiate ultrasonic liposuction from conventional liposuction because of the potential for better sculpting with this technique.</p><p>However, with the advancements of laser-assisted liposuction (SmartLipo Triplex) in the right hands, is able to produce the look of sculpted abs in men or a more defined waistline in women, and this is typically referred to as “high definition liposculpture”.</p><p>The most important determining factor in your result is the qualifications and skill of your plastic surgeon, but that said, in my opinion, laser liposuction (liposculpture) and water-assisted liposuction produce much better and predictable results than with traditional liposuction.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4919" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>It is certainly advantageous to patients in terms of results and recovery. Liposculpture is a term often used by physicians in an attempt to enhance the image of the procedure, regardless of whether or not they have incorporated the new technology that has become available in recent years. (Steven L. Ringler, MD, FACS, Grand Rapids Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction and liposculpture refer to body contouring. I use very fine cannulas to achieve precise results that are most satisfactory. Procedure is performed comfortably using mild sedation tumescent anesthesia and very small incisions with no sutures. (Afshin Farzadmehr, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>There is no difference in the procedure between liposuction and liposculpture. Depending on how it is being used, it is either descriptive or pure marketing.

</div><p>There is no difference between these two procedures. They are both for the treatment of stubborn fat deposits located subcutaneously that are removed with a cannula. (Jerome Edelstein, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Basically both are the same, and techniques used are about the same. Some use the term liposculpture as a marketing term. Some use it to attempt to obtain more definition of the area treated. Most plastic surgeons do try to “sculpt” the area being “sucked” to achieve the best cosmetic results. (Connie Hiers, MD, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>These terms are equivalent. With all liposuction the physician will try to sculpture the area as best possible. Liposculpture is a term many came up with to make their procedure sound more refined. But any will try to do the best with the area that the patient wants improved.

</div><p>Liposculpture describes the use of fat removal using purely tumescent techniques (no general anesthesia) to contour the body into a more favorable silhouette. Liposuction is a more broadly encompassing term often describing the use of larger cannulas to remove fat, often performed under general anesthesia. (Melanie D. Palm, MD – Account Suspended, San Diego Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><b>The Difference Between Liposculpture and Liposuction</b></p><p>The difference between Liposculpture and Liposuction is really in the name. Liposculpture is really a marketing term developed to describe Liposuction. Liposuction is not meant to be a weight loss procedure. It is really meant to be a sculpting procedure where pockets of disproportion are removed and at the same time the area is sculpted to create better contours. (David Amron, MD, Beverly Hills Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4922" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p><em>Liposculpture is not liposuction</em></p><p>True Liposculpting,created discrete muscle definition leading to the creation of a sculpted, atheletic trunk on the surgical table by design. It does utilize suction lipoplasty but the philosophy, the technique and certainly the results are very different. (Edwin Ishoo, MD, Cambridge Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Liposculpture or Liposuction: Twenty five cents or a quarter? Kleenex or Facial Tissue, </em></p><p>Patients who undergo liposculpture have liposuction. Fat is removed by different techniques: LASER, suction, ultrasound, etc. The inventors of the various forms of the removal claim their form of fat removal is less “stressful” to the tissue, less “traumatic” and ensures less downtime and more rapid healing.</p><p>Consider this: the less surgery you perform, the less healing that has to occur, and the faster the return to daily activities. Therefore the more surgery or more invasive surgery that is performed will give a more noticable result.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4923" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-f19c4ee415e49d8539c46bef1e0699a5">

</div><p>Whatever form of surgery that is performed creates local tissue injury. The local tissue injury results in immediate post-operative swelling. The swelling which is part of the healing process takes time to resolve. It is not uncommon for patients immediately post-op to have less swelling than they do one week after surgery.</p><p>For the most part, patients who undergo liposuction need to wear post-operative girdles and garments to help control the post-operative edema and swelling to facilitate more rapid and controlled healing. (Jonathan Berman, MD, Boca Raton Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposculpture uses specific techniques to achieve better body shape. The basis of the technique is the use of the tumescent technique of local anesthesia and artful use of microcannulas to shape cosmetic units of the body. (Edward Lack, MD, Chicago Dermatologist)</p><p><strong>Liposuction</strong>: The removal of skin fat by suctioning<br>
<strong>Liposculpture</strong>: Suctioning the fat in a sculpted fashion to create the ideal body curves. (Ivan Thomas, MD (retired), Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Liposculpture has a fancier name.</b></p><p>While many surgeons refer to “liposculpture” and “liposuction” as totally separate procedures, the truth is that they both involve breaking apart fatty deposits prior to removal with suction. That makes them essentially the same in my book.</p><p>Liposculpture may indicate greater care and finesse on the surgeon’s part to really fine-tune the figure. However, it’s my personal feeling that every surgeon should be performing at his or her highest caliber setting when performing any body sculpting procedure (or frankly any plastic surgery), no matter what name they want to give it.

</div><h5>Liposculpture means “Better than plain old liposuction,” doesn’t it?</h5><p>Liposuction is a basic term that doctors and patients alike all understand. Liposuction has been around for 25 years or so, and there have been major advances and different techniques within the “Liposuction” broad category.</p><p>Even our first liposuction society termed this procedure “Suction-assisted lipoplasty” or SAL, rather than “Liposuction,” which seemed such a generic name! Now we have tumescent liposuction, ultrasonic-assisted lipoplasty (UAL), laser liposuction, Slim-Lipo (laser-assisted), power-assisted lipoplasty (PAL), wet-jet, and even Vaser liposelect! Liposculpture is another generic term meant to imply more finesse and a more sculpted result.</p><p>When I taught liposuction procedures years ago, I told my fellow surgeons that patients are universally interested in FAT REMOVAL! Interestingly, if you hand a random person a hammer, chisel, and a block of marble and tell them to have at it, any idiot can remove marble from that block and put lots of marble chips on the floor! But, how many Michaelangelo statues remain? What your surgeon leaves behind is what gives you your result, so sculpture is perhaps a fitting term for skillful work by experienced surgeons who remove fat.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4926" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-313fe935688988ae2e68b9ece196b42d">

</div><p>There really are some fat sculptors out there, and I think they are entitled to use the term liposculpture. BUT, ask to see examples of their work in patients who look like you. Human tissue, skin tone, elasticity, healing, and surgical skill are all factors that combine to give each patient a unique result!. (Richard H. Tholen, MD, FACS, Minneapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Difference between liposuction and liposculpture.</i></p><p>Clinically, none. The plastic surgeon is removing fat, and letting fat remain. This is sculpture, except you are not made of wood or stone. Many companies now directly market their liposuction box, (laser assisted, ultrasound assisted, water assisted), with catchy names.</p><p>Some doctors do this also. Be aware that these modalities are all different tools to be used by the surgeon. What may be best for you may have nothing to do with the specific tool.</p><p>This is why it is important to see someone who is knowledgeable about all of them. The surgeon should also have an aesthetic sense, and most importantly know the limitations of the surgery. Best to go to a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon.</p><p>They know about risk stratification, the appropriate tool for the job, and they got this knowledge over years of training, (not a weekend course). (Jeffrey J. Roth, MD, FACS, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposculpture is a trademarked term (like Lipo selection) for a TYPE of Liposuction. The terms SUCTION ASSISTED LIPOPLASTY (SAL) = Liposuction = Tumescent Liposuction are synonymous The Sound Surgical Company which produces the VASER (ultrasound assisted lipoplasty (UAL)) system trade marked the term LIPOSELECTION and has been heavily using LIPOSCULPTURE in their marketing. (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>A marketing play on words</h3><p>They are basically the same – it is simply a play on words. This is similar to minifacelift, lifestyle lift, S lift etc. It is just marketing. (David Shuter, MD, Jupiter Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>While Liposcupture is a more recent term, both refer to removal of fat.

(Kimberly Finder, MD, San Antonio Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Difference between liposuction and liposculpture is in the minds of marketers</strong></p><p>It’s not the racket, but the tennis player that wins the game. Ask to look at pictures. If the results are great, then it isn’t so important what technique the surgeon used. I do prefer thin cannulas, and the video explains why.</p><p>Below is an example of using tumescent to really sculpt the lower back area as it transitions to the butt. Details like that are more important than wether the surgeon is using liposelection, liposuction or liposculpture. (Ricardo L.
