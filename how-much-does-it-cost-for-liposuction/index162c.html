<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Liposuction costs vary greatly, mostly depending upon the number of areas treated, which areas those are, and how much fat is going to be removed.</p><p>It’s important to note that the total cost to you will be composed of a surgeon’s fee, an anesthesiologist fee, and a facility fee (for materials, and a place to perform the procedure).</p><p>Some practices do have payment plans. As I mentioned above, liposuction costs vary greatly, but in New York City where I practice, I think in general one could expect to pay between $5,000-$15,000 to have the procedure done by a board certified plastic surgeon. (Keith M. Blechman, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Liposuction cost estimate</i></p><p>Cost is always a main component when deciding to move forward with cosmetic surgery. A very important question to always ask your Board Certified Plastic Surgeon with regard to the quoting is what is included with the fee.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_251" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-5c2b43db30d37388c501e254aa351542">

</div><p>Some facilities will charge separately for anesthesia as well as for the facility usage. When quoting my patients everything is included. I find this helps to eliminate confusion with regard to cost.</p><p>I charge per area treated with one area equaling both sides; for example when charging for the inner thighs this one area includes both the left and the right inner thigh.</p><p>For each additional area the price is discounted by 20%. You will also receive a post-operative kit which includes your compression garments, supplements to help control swelling and bruising, as well as ice packs. A good estimate for liposuction to two areas would be around $5000. (Ronald Downs, MD, FACS, South Bend Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Liposuction in Hawaii – How Much Does It Cost?</em></p><p>The cost of liposuction in Hawaii is all over the board. Some surgeons do some areas for free if it is part of a larger surgical area. Some surgeons charge as much as $7,000 for the first area, and up to $2,000 for every area after that.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_252" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Some charge as little as $4,000 for four areas. If the surgery is done correctly and you get a great result and you feel well taken care of, then the surgery is worth the price. If the quality of the surgery or the people taking care of you are substandard, then the surgery is not worth the price.</p><p>Liposuction is one area where the buyer has to be informed as to the value of what they are getting more than just the price. For instance, Vaser, Laser, Slim, Smart, etc. liposuction are no better than traditional liposuction, and in hands of many surgeons, it is actually worse.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_253" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a67005cac22d88860b8bc554cc6dd331">

</div><p>When you are looking at the price of liposuction, be sure you are not paying extra for technology that doesn’t improve the final result. Traditional liposuction with the addition of tumescent in the hands of an experienced liposuction Board Certified plastic surgeon will give you the best result every time.</p><p>The cost of any cosmetic surgery includes the surgeon’s fee, anesthesia fee, and the cost of the operating room.</p><p>There are also value added areas the informed consumer must ask about:</p><ol>
<li>who pays for the girdle;</li>
<li>how many post surgery visits do I get with the cost of the liposuction;</li>
<li>do I see the surgeon on multiple post surgery visits for the evaluation of my surgery and recovery or just an employee;</li>
<li>if there is a complication, who pays for the revision;</li>
<li>am I being operated on in a certified surgery center or just a doctor’s office;</li>
<li>does the surgeon use any modalities to decrease post op swelling and bruising to speed my recovery.</li>
</ol><p>If you are significantly bruised after liposuction and you are unable to go back to work for two to three weeks or longer, then the surgery cost a whole lot more than the surgery. At the Mommy Makeover Institute of Hawaii, the surgeon’s fee and the operating room fees are lumped together, and there are no hidden after costs.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_254" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>You get a full disclosure of the cost up front. The first area is $5,500 and each area after that is $1,000. The anesthesia fee is $250 per hour, and we only use Board Certified anesthesiologists. We pay for the girdle, and if revision surgery is needed which happens about once every 500 surgeries, it is on the house.</p><p>The requirement for any lipo-sculpture surgeon is that he or she has three basic elements, the HAND, EYE and HEART. The HAND indicates the surgeon is skillful and doesn’t depend on expensive laser technologies to accomplish what an experienced surgeon should be able to do.</p><p>The EYE indicates the surgeon has an aesthetic sense, and he or she knows what looks good and what doesn’t. Lipo-sculpture is not just debulking an area of fat, but making the area look aesthetically pleasing.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_255" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-34472a33856e140ff0bbe7104c389084">

</div><p>And the most important element is the HEART. This means that the surgeon and his entire staff care about you as a patient and as a person, and ultimately about your happiness with reference to the results of your surgery. (S. Larry Schlesinger, MD, FACS, Honolulu Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Cost of lipo</em> varies from region to region. Yes multiple areas of liposuction often are given a discount given that the procedure will take place under the same anesthesia and OR room times. (Michael J. Yoo, MD, Irvine Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>The cost of liposuction depends on several factors, including:</h3><ul>
<li>
<strong>Geographical location</strong>. The midwest tends to be less expensive than the east and west coasts.</li>
<li>
<strong>How many areas you are having treated</strong>. The more areas you have treated, the less expensive the cost per area.</li>
<li>
<strong>Your body size</strong>. A larger body means more fat to remove, which takes longer.</li>
<li>
<strong>Facility and anesthesia fee</strong>. Liposuction is less expensive if you have it done with tumescent anesthesia. instead of general anesthesia.</li>
</ul><p>This is a very safe and effective option in the right hands. I personally do most of my cases this way, and I perform about 200 liposuction operations yearly. In the Cleveland area you can expect to pay around $4500-$6000 to have liposuction of the abdomen and waist.</p><p>Seeing a board-certified plastic surgeon for a consultation will give you an exact number. (Jennifer Greer, MD, Cleveland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It is not possible to give a fee schedule for body areas, as body weights vary, and in one person, there may be more fat to remove in an area than in that area on another person, and thus, one person may well have a different fee to treat several body areas than a slightly thinner person having the same body areas suctioned.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_257" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-056b452d0be00971c3be6f3afc00ca18">

</div><p>So, the time needed to perform adequate fat removal must be factored into the surgeon’s fee (and we do give price breaks when combination procedures are done), but, also, the operating room time and anesthesia fees charged are generally based on the time you are in the operating room, so the time factor plays a part in those fees, too.</p><p>The exception to this would be if your lipo is done under sedation and local anesthesia, which many plastic surgeons are now doing in their own facilities. And although your procedure may cost between 5 and 10,000 dollars, it is still the best way to achieve the contours you could probably never get on your own, short of losing a massive amount of total body weight.</p><p>Also, most plastic surgeons offer financing, so the payments over time can be quite affordable. (James H. Scheu, MD, FACS, Saint Louis Plastic Surgeon)<br>
The cost of Liposuction will vary depending on different varieties like the country you are thinking of having the procedure, the work that needs to be done,and also the experience of the plastic surgeon.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_258" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>And It also important to know that there are different techniques and newer technology used so depending on what you are looking for. I recommend to seek for a board certified plastic surgeon and discuss what are your goals and concerns.(Ricardo Ventura, MD, Dominican Republic Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Liposuction fees</em></p><p>Every surgeon has a method by which he or she sets fees for this procedure. Some have a base fee and go up in price by body area, some price by body area alone.</p><p>I base my fees on OR time and charge a flat $1000 per hour. Most cases take anywhere from 2 to 5 hours including room turning over time which is factored into my fee. When I see a patient in the office I can get a good grasp of the estimated time based on the exam and listening to the treatment goals of the patient.</p><p>For me, it doesn’t matter how much volume or whether you are doing flanks or abdomen it is my time and expertise that you pay for as a patient. My staff will not quote a liposuction fee over the phone other than the general estimate of 2-5 hours at $1000 per hour.</p><p>This is a reasonable practice for my office and is what works well for me. (Brian Kiesnowski, MD, MPH, Appleton Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction fees vary based on your demographic area. When you get a fee, make sure it includes physician fee, facility fee, and anesthesia. It is difficult to obtain a good result without anesthesia involved. In my clinic there is an initial fee for the first area and then each additional area is reduced.</p><p>An average cost for liposuction of one area would be around $3500. (Michael S. Birndorf, MD, Milwaukee Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Well, the cost of a liposuction will vary depending on the work that needs to be done, the country and the doctor fees where you will be having the procedure. (Tania Medina de Garcia, MD, Dominican Republic Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_256" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>Liposuction cost varies widely with the number of body areas treated, the amount of time for the operation, and your geographic location. In the NYC area where I practice, small volume lipo of a single area will likely run $4k-$8k.</p><p>Larger volumes and more areas come with more cost, up to $15k-$20k depending. (Joshua D. Zuckerman, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction is usually priced per area treated. The price therefore, can vary from a couple thousand dollars up to the mid teens depending on how many areas will be treated. Consultation with a board certified plastic surgeon will allow you to see which areas can be treated with liposuction and how many areas can safely be treated during one surgery. (Tyler Angelos, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>As you probably can surmise, the cost is highly variable. In general, the cost will increase based on the amount of time the procedure takes, the quality of the facility used, if there is an overnight stay, and whether or not anesthesia is required.</p><p>It is difficult – even impossible to quote costs over the phone or internet, as it is necessary to see the patient in person to make these decisions for each individual.
