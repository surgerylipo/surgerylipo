<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><i>Liposuction of the neck typically causes only minor discomfort</i></p><p>Laser Assisted Liposuction of the chin or neck region typically causes only minor discomfort in my experience.</p><p>Prior to the liposuction a long acting local anesthetic solution is instilled into the area of the neck beneath the chin.</p><p>This should provide pain relief for 24 hours. Since the chin neck area is a quiet area, that is there are not large muscles which cause powerful movement as in the arm or leg area, any liposuction procedure tends to be less painful in the neck area than in the arm and leg area.</p><p>My impression has been that patients who have liposuction of the neck and chin using Laser Assisted Liposuction with the SlimLipo laser device experience less discomfort and quicker recovery than my previous patients using the older non laser liposuction techniques.

</div><h5>Minimal discomfort with neck liposuction</h5><p>Liposuction of the chin and neck is a relatively easy procedure with minimal discomfort and pain associated with it. Patients are amazed at how easy the procedure is and how quickly they recover afterwards. It is very safe and comfortable to do under local tumescent anesthesia.</p><p>Light sedation with valium and demerol helps to put an anxious patient at ease. It is unnecessary to undergo general anesthesia for this minor procedure. (M. Christine Lee, MD, Walnut Creek Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Liposuction of small areas usual results in minimal discomfort</h4><p>Small cannula and particularly laser assisted or SmartLiposuction techniques typically result in minimal discomfort and a fast recovery. Local anesthetic solution is used during the surgery and this provides hours of pain relief after your procedure.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3513" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>The underlying muscle will be tender but this is easily managed with over the counter medications, ice and the use of the a compression garment used during the first few days. There are usually one or two small incisions in the skin but no incisions in the underlying muscle.</p><p>So overall there is minimal injury to the tissue and therefore little pain. Patients with this condition are some of our happiest because the correction is considered “easy”. (Mathew C. Mosher, MD, Vancouver Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>If performed by an experienced and expert board certified plastic surgeon, liposuction of the neck should not be painful. Subsequent to the procedure, patients tend to little to no pain medicine. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3514" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-c7b3e0b9854ed013c1592278f6f706f4">

</div><p>Liposuction surgery done by experienced plastic surgeons should not be painful. Usually these procedures involve a small/superficial surface area that is treated and patients tolerate procedure extremely well. (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Liposuction of the neck is painless and swift</h3><p>When People magazine highlighted the new “lunchtime lipo” they were referring to laser-assisted liposuction of the neck, which is a relatively short and virtually painless procedure. (Daniel Levy, MD, Bellevue Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Neck liposuction is often comfortable </i></p><p>In my experience, most of our patients are often comfortable after this procedure. In medicine we use a scale for pain – 1 – 10 with ten being the worst. Typically, neck liposuction is closer to a one on this scale.</p><p>Of course, everyone is different in their perception of pain, however it is usually well-controlled with a mild analgesic. (George John Alexander, MD, FACS, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Liposuction under the chin may be performed so that it is absolutely pain free</em></p><p>Liposuction under the chin may be performed so that it is absolutely pain free. It may be done under local anesthesia alone (where the only discomfort felt, is during the injection of the local anesthetic), but more commonly I use IV sedation as well during the procedure, so that no pain is felt at all.</p><p>With IV sedation, often referred to as “twilight sleep,” patients are given just enough intravenous medication so that they don’t feel any discomfort during the procedure. A general anesthetic is usually thought to be unnecessary for such a simple procedure.</p><p>There is very little discomfort following the procedure. (Michael R. Macdonald, MD, Bay Area Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction of the neck can be performed under local anesthesia and patients afterwards complain of minimal to moderate discomfort that can be managed with Tylenol and pain meds. (Pat Pazmino, MD, FACS, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction under the chin is really not painful. It’s such a small area and only a local anesthesia is used. When we have patients that are nervous, we can give them a little something to relax them.</p><p>Also we call in a prescription for some pain medication if needed. Most patients don’t need pain medication for liposuction of the submental (chin) and jowl area. You’ll be surprised how easy it is. (Bruce E. Katz, MD, New York Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction of the Chin and Neck can be done with mild sedation (IE a pill of Valium) and tumescent liposuction. EXCELLENT skin shrinkage can be obtained if done with a LASER LIPO such as Sciton’s PROLipo or Palomar’s SLIMLipo. (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction of the chin and neck is commonly done with local anesthesia only. Numbing the neck is a bit uncomfortable, but after that it’s not painful at all. Patients can drive themselves to and from the procedure and return to work whenever they wish. (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Minimal pain with chin and neck liposuction.</b></p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3516" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>Liposuction of the chin and neck is simple , safe, and not painful. Some patients don’t even need a Tylenol afterwards. It takes 30 minutes, and you are back at work in 5 days or less. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Chin or submental liposuction in general results in mild, short term discomfort that lasts for several days. A mild analgesic or even Tylenol suffices in most persons for pain control. Some persons experience cervical muscle spasm which takes a bit more time to resolve.</p><p>Severe pain should be brought to the attention of the surgeon to ensure that a large collection of blood (hematoma) has not occurred. (Lee Kleiman, MD, Annapolis Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Pain after Chin Liposuction should be minimal</h5><p>if you’re talking about postoperative pain (your plastic surgeon has plenty of options to keep you comfortable during the surgery), you shouldn’t be too uncomfortable afterwards. Most patients will have soreness following the procedure that is easily controlled with medication.</p><p>Given the relative comfort of the procedure, you might think that your results will be less impressive; nothing could be further from the truth! Generally speaking, the results from liposuction of the neck are the most impressive and consistent.</p><p>With good technique and proper patient selection, the change in appearance of this area with liposuction can be remarkable. (Brian K. Brzowski, MD, FACS, Ogden Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction of the neck should not be painful. If it is performed under purely local anesthesia, you will feel the local anesthesia being infiltrated. That stings a bit. You may want to talk to your doctor about getting some sedation (i.e. valium) before the procedure. For very phobic patients, it is possible to perform the procedure under IV sedation or light general anesthesia. (Brent Moelleken, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Depends on your pain tolerance</strong></p><p>Liposuction of the neck should be minimally uncomfortable to most people however if you are an anxious type and have a low pain threshold, it might be more uncomfortable. Certainly not to the point though where you would have a hard time recovering or regret that you did the procedure. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Minimal discomfort for liposuction under chin</b></p><p>Liposuction of small areas (including under the chin) can often be done with minimal discomfort both during the procedure and the recovery. Depending on your preference and that of your surgeon, liposuction of small areas can be done under local anesthesia with the added use of an oral relaxation and/or pain pill.</p><p>This way the expense and recovery from general anesthesia can be avoided with the trade off that you will be awake during the procedure and be aware of some of what is going on during the procedure.</p><p>If you prefer to not be aware of the procedure at all and feel absolutely nothing, a general anesthetic may be preferable. (Farzad R. Nahai, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction of the neck is done with a tumescent technique that contains local anaesthesia. In general, it is such a small area, so it should not be very painful or too discomforting! (Hisham Seify, MD, PhD, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Chin Lipo can be pain free with proper local anesthesia</h4><p>Once proper local anesthesia of the neck and chin has been administrated, the liposuction should be pain free. First, a small amount of local anesthesia is injected followed by infiltration of tumescent anesthesia More importantly you must make certain that the liposuction of the submental (under the chin ) area will help you.</p><p>If the fatty tissue is below the muscle of the neck (Sub-Platysmal), liposuction will not address that and an open approach is warranted. (Amir Moradi, MD, San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Neck sculpting relatively pain-free</em></p><p>Liposuction of the neck is a relatively pain free procedure. It can be done under straight local or some sedation. The procedure takes about 15-20 minutes and you are back to activities very soon after. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Neck Liposuction should not be very painful</h4><p>You could do the procedure under general anesthesia and you will not experience any pain during the procedure and very mild discomfort afterwards. If it is just the neck or submental area being addressed, it can certainly be done under local with sedation or in some cases under local alone.</p><p>I usually recommend some sort of sedation, whether it is a pill or given via IV. It just makes the experience much more comfortable for you and your surgeon. (Farbod Esmailian, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
