<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>By definition Lipo (fat) Suction (vacuum removal) requires putting a suction device into the fat to remove it. So ALL liposuction by its very definition IS surgical.</p><p>There are a lot of nonsurgical methods which claim fat REMOVAL – most of these either do not work, work unpredictably or work poorly.</p><p>Attempts to dissolve fat with injections into it of a cocktail of non FDA approved drugs (IE Mesotherapy, Lipodissolve etc) have been disappointing and generated a lot of unhappy patients, hard to repair deformities and a lot of lawsuites.</p><p>There are devices out there (Zerona, Zeltiq) which CLAIM to be able to melt fat by “painting” the skin with the laser (Zerona) otherwise commonly used in pointing devices (if you believe this claim – can I interest you in a bridge connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn???) while another device (Zeltiq) pinches a fold of your tummy each treatment and freezes it in a cold vise for 45 minutes hoping the icicles forming in the fat will permanently destroy the fat.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4334" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>After several such sessions you more than pay the cost of a liposuction.</p><p>In general the companies producing these devices create media hype with seductive adds, poorly substantiated claims and testimonials from certain physicians who receive free machines and who are paid to lecture widely on the virtues of these machines…until the machines are proven useless and a new crop of machines appear starting a new hype cycle to suck the public into. (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>There is no such thing as nonsurgical liposuction</b></p><p>There may be nonsurgical methods of treating fat, but they are not liposuction. Liposuction can be done by different methods, but they all involve inserting devices into the fat to remove the fat. That’s surgery.</p><p>Lipodissolve, or mesotherapy, involves injecting compounds into the fat to dissolve it, but it is not liposuction. External methods of applying energy in order to reduce fat are also not liposuction. Be wary of spending money on these methods thinking they’re substitutes for liposuction – they’re not. (Douglas J. Mackenzie, MD, Santa Barbara Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4335" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h5>Non-surgical liposuction – Ultrashape and other alternatives</h5><p>“Non-surgical liposuction” is a misnomer as liposuction is always surgical. Non-surgical alternatives to liposuction include several non-invasive procedures that can reduce or destroy fat without liposuction or any other form of surgery.</p><p>Liposuction is still the gold-standard for fat removal. Whether tumescent, ultrasonic, laser assisted etc., liposuction gurantees that, at the end of the procedure, the removed fat is in a container and so can be seen and measured.</p><p>No non-surgical technique can promise that. There are several non-invasive procedures that claim to reduce unwanted fat. Most of these devices only manipulate the fat cells, not destroy them, and so give a temporary result that disappears soon after the treatments stop.</p><p>Others, such as UltraShape and Liposonix, use ultrasound waves to actually destroy fat cells without surgery and have scientific data to back these claims. In our clinic in Montreal UltraShape has been used since 2007 with very good, consistent results.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4336" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Generally, we only offer this treatment to patients who refuse to have lipo or any other surgery as we feel that it is the best non-surgical alternative for fat reduction. These patients lose nearly two inches, on average, after three treatments with UltraShape.</p><p>Montreal has many non-medical clinics that offer alternatives to liposuction but, other than UltraShape and Liposonix, most of these have no scientific proof that they actually work. UltraShape will never replace lipo nor be as predictable.</p><p>However, this procedure is an alternative for patients who do not want lipo or its side effects. Please have a look at the attached video for more information. (Arie Benchetrit, MD, Montreal Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>“Non surgical liposuction” to me sounds like a misnomer as no fat is actually sucked out, it stays put. The gamut of non surgical lipolysis modalities at best result in subtle, minimal or photoshopped results.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4337" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>To achieve structural change you need surgery and the best way to get rid of fat is to actually remove it. Surgical liposuction remains the gold standard for result oriented body contouring. (Sameer Karkhanis, MS, DNB, India Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Non surgical liposuction will not give you the same results as liposuction surgery. Lasers and freezing fat through the skin have little to no affect on the fatty tissue beneath the skin.</p><p>With liposuction, the fat is actually removed from underneath the skin and you can see dramatic results. (Robert Heck, MD, FACS, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I utilize non-surgical liposuction as part of my liposuction practice. My procedure of choice for non surgical liposuction is Liposonix, as it provides amazing longterm results. (Raffy Karamanoukian, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4338" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>While it’s true that there may be bruising after your liposuction procedure, the bottom line is that traditional lipo remains the gold standard for body sculpting. Liposuction alternatives that freeze the fat cells, or laser treatments that are supposed to accomplish the same end results without surgery, just don’t deliver the same reliable results.</p><p>If you’re concerned about the after-effects of your lipo, I strongly suggest only going to a board-certified plastic surgeon for your treatment. A plastic surgeon will have the experience necessary to give you the results you want, and the right skill level to promote a quick and easy recovery as much as possible. (Frank Campanile, MD, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div></center><p><em>A Liposuction Alternative for love handles</em></p><p>For isolated fat collections in areas such as the love handles, the new technology of CoolSculpting has shown outstanding results. CoolSculpting freezes fat cells which are the most susceptible cells in the body to cold, and ice crystals that form in the fat cells cause these cells to dissolve and go away forever.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4339" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>CoolSculpting can’t be used everywhere on the body, but in the love handles, abdomen, back, and medial thighs we have seen fantastic results.</p><p>There is not any significant down time or recovery associated with CoolSculpting which might also explain the popularity of this in my practice.</p><p>For otherwise fit patients who have isolated bulges in the abdomen, flanks, back, and medial thighs, excellent results have been seen in my practice with even one treatment using CoolSculpting. Some patients require more than one treatment per area, particularly if they are looking for a large reduction in fat.</p><p>Newer CoolSculpting protocols are using multiple treatments per area and getting results that approach that of liposuction. (Adam David Lowenstein, MD, FACS, Santa Barbara Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The best way to remove fat is by liposuction or excision. There are some studies that have been done using LASER to decrease fat in a noninvasive way. One of these LASER studies was done along with Dr. Frank Greenway and is awaiting publication. We also published a good study of decreasing fat using a proprietary mesotherapy formula. I think these two methods are useful for small amounts of fat but liposuction is better for large areas of fatty deposits.

</div><p><b>With non-surgical liposuction you can achieve good results but only for minor fat deposits </b></p><p>For really minor fat deposits you could use ultrafocus ultrasound, non surgical liposuction. The most important thing is that you keep your expectations realistic. Ultrasound Lipo, VASER, etc. can achieve good results. (Alberto Di Giuseppe, MBBS, London Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>No Such Thing as Non Surgical Liposuction</b></p><p>There is no controversy – ONLY LIPOSUCTION WILL GIVE THE SAME RESULTS AS LIPOSUCTION. The many other purported techniques such as Zerona, Zeltiq and others at best will give some minimal to mild benefit. (Larry S. Nichter, MD, MS, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Non Surgical Liposuction techniques such as Coolsculpting can yield some benefit. Patients with a BMI between 20 to 30 or patients with loose skin would be better off with liposuction surgery. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Non-surgical body contouring techniques could help, but are not as practical as liposuction. Liposuction mechanicaly removes fat from the body and that makes it work better. (Hisham Seify, MD, PhD, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Non surgical liposuction is improving</h4><p>We use the Coolsculpt machine by Zeltiq and we have been very happy with the results. In fact, I was very skeptical since i am a plastic surgeon. One of our patients has had 14 different sessions in different areas with a tremendous results.</p><p>However, the results are not as good as liposuction. With liposuction we can contour 360 degrees and enhance certain features and de-emphasize others. Coolsculpting is best for battling bulges like lower abdomen, love handles, inner thighs, and bra roll. (Pramit Malhotra, MD, Ann Arbor Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Liposuction bruising does not last for 6 months</h5><p>Bruising from formal liposuction lasts for about two weeks. However, it produces significant results as compared to nonsurgical methods which have been shown to marginally alter body contour. Lower level procedures produce lesser results and, ultimately are not cost effective.</p><p>Many patients are unsatisfied with the outcome and then opt for a comprehensive procedure with a board certified plastic surgeon, effectively paying twice. I can think of no procedure that, when properly performed, would produce six months of bruising. (Robert L. Kraft, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)<br>

But that’s about the only way to make that happen. Liposuction is SURGERY, period. Incisions must be made in the skin to allow the suction cannula to pass beneath the skin to remove the fat.</p><p>That’s surgery. Mesotherapy is not FDA-approved, and I’ve seen plenty of problems as a result of mesotherapy–all very difficult to correct. Zerona is low-level laser therapy, applied externally (not surgery)–but it’s not liposuction and leaves the fat cells in place. (Carmen Kavali, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I wonder what non surgical liposuction is? Is it an external device that treats the fat to help dissolve it? Is there no invasive technique and therefore, a true non surgical procedure. If so, it shouldn’t be called liposuction.</p><p>The suction refers to an invasive procedure. A cannula is moved back and forth through the fat and removes the fat via suction. This is surgery. It is impossible to answer your question without knowing what the surgeon truly intends to do. (Ronald Shelton, MD, Manhattan Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>You will get much better results with liposuction. Even when we remove a large amount of fat the patient goes to work in 3-4 days and the bruising is gone in 2-3 weeks!. (Toby Mayer, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
