What you weight is determined by what your eat and what you metabolize. If you eat less or exercise more, you will loose weight.</p><p>However, if you have liposuction, every bit of the fat that is removed will find its way back onto your body.</p><p>The fat will be less of an issue where it was removed by liposuction and tends to be more uniformly distributed, which is why liposuction is all about body shaping.</p><p>If you are looking to actually loose weight, don’t waste your money on liposuction. You can spend much less working with a dietician and find a work out that you can safely do 5 or 6 times a week.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4150" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>If this old fashion way of loosing weight does not work for you, you might look into lap band surgery. (Kenneth D. Steinsapir, MD, Beverly Hills Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p>The amount of weight that you lose with liposuction depends on what your aesthetic goals are and how much fat is actually removed. However, you can expect to lose around 5 lbs on average if you get your entire abdomen liposuctioned.</p><p>It may be more or less as it’s hard to say without actully seeing you in person. (Jeffrey E. Schreiber, MD, FACS, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Large volume liposuction can removed significant amount of fat and weight from a person. I have had patients who had lost 30 lbs of fat with large volume liposuction and have gone down six sizes after liposuction surgery.

</div><p>Liposuction is not a weight loss procedure but rather a body contouring procedure. You will in fact weigh more immediately after the procedure due to the fluids from the procedure and swelling after the procedure.</p><p>Once the swelling has decreased you should only expect to have lost no more than 5 lbs depending on the areas treated. The ideal candidate for liposuction is someone who is at a stable, goal weight but still with some problem areas to be contoured. (Tyler Angelos, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Lose Weight Before Undergoing Liposuction</i></p><p>Unfortunately, liposuction is a sculpting tool not a weight loss tool. At most, you may lose a few pounds from the removal of fat. Tumescent liposuction removal of more than a certain volume of fat can be dangerous. (Joshua D. Zuckerman, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4152" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><em>Amount of weight loss after liposuction</em></p><p>Liposuction is not a weight loss procedure so the amount of weight that you can lose tend to be no more than 5-6 pounds. The method to gauge liposuction results is its ability to contour a body. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I usually see about 1 pound for every Liter of fat removed. That is not a lot! However, you will loose inches, feel more comfortable in your clothing and have more effective exercise that targets other areas.</p><p>For some reason abdomen and waist (love handles) are difficult to remove with standard exercise.</p><p>It can be done, but my thought is that you have have to have the correct exercise protocol and the correct diet.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4153" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>Both of these goals are challenged by a very poor diet in our society. Overall, aggressive liposuction has a high satisfaction rate. (Paul C. Dillon, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Liposuction is not a method for weight loss</em></p><p>Don’t do it for weight loss. Even if you have high volume liposuction which is considered to be beyond 5 liters, this will only amount to 11 pounds of weight loss. (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You cannot safely lose any significant weight from liposuction – period. The only proper use of this procedure is in contouring problem areas after diet and exercise have failed.</p><p>In a rare case, some liposuction can jump start a weight loss program but this use should be very rare. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><amp-img class="size-medium wp-image-4154 amp-wp-unknown-size amp-wp-unknown-width amp-wp-unknown-height amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2017/09/index.html" alt="Liposuction PreOp & PostOp By Dr. Arnold S. Breitbart, MD, FACS, Long Island Plastic Surgeon" width="600" height="400" layout="fixed"></amp-img></p><p>Liposuction isn’t to decrease our weight. It’s just to recontour your body. Any weight loss will be limited to a couple of pounds at most. Liposuction helps you improve your appearance, not make you lose weight. (Ronald Levine, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Liposuction is NOT a weight loss operation</h4><p>Patients commonly ask their surgeon how much weight they can expect to loose from a liposuction procedure. I always stress to my patients that liposuction is not a weight loss operation and that patients rarely see much of a difference when they step on the scale (maybe 5 pounds or so).</p><p>The most ideal candidate for liposuction is a patient who has good skin tone and localized fat collections that they wish to remove and the most satisfied liposuction patients are those who had realistic expectations in targeting these stubborn ‘problem’ areas. Remember, fat weighs like feathers. (Stephen T. Greenberg, MD, Woodbury Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4155" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-2bf4d68df5193fb91b84fa6c8f88ee0a">

</div><p>Liposuction generally removes between 2 and up to 10 lbs of weight for the usual candidate. Since it doesn’t prevent you from regaining weight in other areas but simply permanently reduces your ability to store fat in the treated area it is not a wise choice for weight loss purposes. (Jon A. Perlman, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Liposuction is not a weight loss tool</h5><p>Liposuction is not a weight loss tool, and should not be treated as such. Rather, liposuction can work well to improve the contour of the body, giving the appearance of having lost some weight.</p><p>A liposuction procedure can sometimes help people to kick start a new diet and lifestyle, as they see what they can look like after weight loss; however, if you continue to gain weight after a liposuction procedure, the results will not last.</p><p>Liposuction is best for people who are able to maintain a steady weight. I recommend visiting a board-certified dermatologist or plastic surgeon experienced in liposuction procedures who can evaluate you and see if you are a good candidate for liposuction or not. (Mitchel P. Goldman, MD, San Diego Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Patients should strive to be at their goal weight when undergoing liposuction to achieve the best results. After surgery, patients are encouraged to maintain or lose 5% of body weight with proper diet and exercise as liposuction is not a form of weight lose, but a surgical approach to remove the fat cells. (Jeffrey Weinzweig, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction is not for weight loss. Rather, it is effective at redistributing fat that may be collected in certain areas of your body. For example, a person at a healthy weight and a good level of fitness may continue to have excess fat cells in their outer thighs or waist.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4157" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>Liposuction can be very effective in helping to reshape these limited areas of fat. Though this rarely results in weight loss, it can achieve a different body shape, therefore helping the individual reach their goals. (Emily A. Williams, MD, Spokane Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Liposuction is NOT a weight loss solution</b></p><p>While liposuction can take off a few pounds at most, most patients gain this weight back almost immediately.</p><p>The improvement is in a patient’s contour, not his/her weight. Even if he/she does not gain it back, the weight reduction will be extremely small in comparison to what you are looking for. (David P. Rapaport, MD, FACS, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction is not done to lose weight its mainly done to shape your body, the most you can lose is 3-4 pounds, it is not a weight loss procedure. (Mel T. Ortega, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction is not a replacement for good old-fashioned diet and exercise. The only real way to lose weight is by burning more calories than you consume, which means eating right and staying active. Then, once you’ve reached your target weight, lipo can be used to smooth out one or two problem areas, like the love handles or back fat.</p><p>If any weight is lost after lipo, it’s as a side effect, and isn’t the primary goal of the procedure. Although it’s minimally invasive, liposuction is still a surgery, and surgery of any kind should be avoided if you’re overweight or not in good general health.</p><p>Liposuction results look best on patients who are already in pretty good shape and just have a couple fat pockets that diet and exercise haven’t been able to resolve. (David N. Sayah, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction is great for improving contours of fat deposits. The fat tissue is removed and there is some weight loss that is associated with it but the main goal is reduction of size. Most patients are disappointed with liposuction if they do it for weight loss purposes.</p><p>The best time to do liposuction is when you are at or close to your normal living weight. This is when you will be the most satisfied with the procedure and get lasting results. (Marcus L. Peterson, MD, Saint George Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4156" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-06a1a06cc8830174602f4e0e25999fef">

</div><p>Liposuction is not intended to be a weight loss procedure. If you weighed yourself immediately after the procedure you would very likely weigh more than you did prior to the operation. This is due to the fact that there is associated swelling and retention of fluid for a period of time after the procedure.</p><p>After healing is complete, and if there is no other weight loss or weight gain, the amount of weight you would lose would be the weight of the actual fat that was removed during the course of the procedure.</p><p>This might range anywhere from one pound to six pounds, depending on the amount of fat removed. (John J. Edney, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction is not a weight loss tool. It is a body contouring tool. A person should be near his ideal body weight when having liposuction.
