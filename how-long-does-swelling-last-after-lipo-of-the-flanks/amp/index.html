<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Swelling after liposuction of the flanks can take up to three months to resolve. Even areas that look “bumpy” can resolve during this time. I remind patients that liposuction is an invasive procedure that causes some trauma to the underlying fat, blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves.</p><p>Numbness and tingling after liposuction can also take 3-6 months to resolve. Complications such chronic seromas (fluid collections under skin) are known to occur. I recommend that you follow up with your plastic surgeon to make sure what your are seeing is normal post-op liposuction symptoms. (Robert Najera, MD, Frisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It takes up to 6-9 months for a complete healing to take its effect . The initial swelling and bruising should resolve within 4-6 weeks. </p><p>The compression garment should help significantly. Keep in mind that the healing capacity depends on many factors, such as: your environment, smoking, stress, nutrition, etc. (Thomas Trevisani, Sr., MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_10985" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Most swelling is resolved about 6 weeks post liposuction, however it can take 3-6 months for all swelling to resolve depending on the operated area and amount of fat removed. Most people see immediate improvement that increases over time as long as a healthy diet is maintained. (Yannis Alexandrides, MD, London Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Swelling after liposuction of the flanks is entirely normal – a compressive garment is essential for the 1st 4 to 6 weeks to help with this. Most swelling is gone in the first 2 weeks but minor swelling persists for 3 months or longer (up to one year in some cases).</p><p>Numbness can also be normal and should return within several months of surgery in most cases. (Nicolas M. Hynes, MD, Hamilton Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction swelling can last as long as 3 months. I typically tell my patients about 85 percent of the swelling is gone after about 6 weeks. I recommend wearing a compressive garment for 6 weeks. (Stephen M. Miller, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_10986" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Swelling can last for several weeks but can be limited by using the appropriate garment and massage. (Frank J. Ferraro, MD, Paramus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It’s quite common for there to be significant swelling for several months after liposuction of the flanks. The amount of time it takes to go away depends on how much fat was removed and how aggressively it was removed.</p><p>I have found that when local anesthesia and microcannulas are used, most swelling resolves in 8-10 weeks, but it can take up to 6 months for it to completely resolve in some patients. (Lawrence Osman, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Is is not usual during the early postoperative period to still have areas of diminished sensation and palpable and visible contour irregularities . Most of these will improve over time during the postoperative healing period which is a minimum of three months postoperative.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_10987" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-3f989d4e6456ec2d50ebe3caebe360e6">

</div><p>You should voice any concerns to your surgeon as well. (Michael H. Wojtanowski, MD, Cleveland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>When all goes well, the swelling following liposuction will go away in about 8 weeks. If there is considerable bruising, this draws more edema and will probably delay the resorption a bit. The complete healing will take 8 to 12 months.</p><p>So, be patient with final results. (Ahmet R. Karaca, MD, Birmingham Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I tell patients there will be bruising and swelling. The bruising is usually gone in 2 or 3 weeks but swelling takes longer. </p><p>I advise patients that about 80% of edema will resolve in 6-8 weeks but it may take 6-8 months for the remainder of the edema to resolve completely and see the final result. (Jeffrey D. Wagner, MD, Indianapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_10988" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-0297449e47bc5b26dc0b885dffcb9392">

</div><p>Swelling from liposuction may last up to 6 months. Wearing the appropriate garment, diet and exercise will help reduce your swelling time. (Jeffrey Weinzweig, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Swelling or edema after liposuction lasts for several months, with final results not wholly evident until 6 months or more after surgery. Wearing a compression garment can hasten the resolution of swelling. Discuss your concerns with your surgeon. (Lara Devgan, MD, MPH, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Liposuction results are slow</h4><p>Recovery from liposuction takes a long time. You can resume most activities within a few days, but you have to wait to exercise. Otherwise your skin, which has been separated from the deep tissues will bounce and be uncomfortable.</p><p>A support garment is useful for about 4 weeks to hold the skin in the right place. Bruising is variable and is usually gone in 3 weeks. Swelling takes months. Most of it is gone within 2 to 3 months but the remainder can take 6 months or more.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_10989" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Massage may help small irregularities. (John Silverton, MD, Stockton Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Recovery from swelling after liposuction of the flanks depends on the area of treatment. The face and arms usually take 4 weeks for 80-90% of it to go down. The torso takes 4-6 weeks for the same amount of swelling to improve.</p><p>The thighs, including your saddlebag liposuction, usually take 6-8 weeks for the swelling to go down. Gravity and body position (the amount you lie down, sit up, stand, etc.) significantly influence the time it takes to recover from swelling.</p><p>This can be shortened by wearing the proper compression garments, eating healthy, and taking beneficial supplements, like Arnica (I recommend Traumeel). About 3 months after surgery, I usually find that the tissues will begin to tighten up due to the contraction of subcutaneous fibers (septae).</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_10990" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>This is stimulated by resistance training and will continue to tighten for up to a year. If you have persistent swelling for longer than described, you should see your surgeon to rule out any complications, such as a seroma. (Gabriel Chiu, DO, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction swelling can last for a few months after the procedure. The lower body swelling (legs) tends to last longer than upper body swelling, and gravity can be your enemy in this case.</p><p>I recommend that my patients wear a compression garment for 3 weeks continuously and then for 3 weeks after that at night.</p><p>This helps the swelling improve more quickly and helps the skin redistribute and contract. Contraction can take up to a year to happen, so you will not get to your final result for approximately a year after treatment.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_10991" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Numbness will improve as the swelling decreases. (Louis C. Cutolo, Jr., MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Liposuction Swelling Subsides in 3-4 Weeks</b></p><p>The amount of swelling varies from person to person and your activity level. Patients can expect moderate bruising and swelling after the procedure. The swelling typically subsides about 1 month after the procedure. (David L. Robbins, MD, FACS, West Des Moines Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Liposuction Swelling Duration</h4><p>At 6 weeks you may still be experiencing swelling and evolving results. Mobile fluid may need to addressed by your surgeon as he/she can remove the fluid. You should talk to your surgeon about recommendations to smooth the results and improve upon them since 6 weeks is a great time to modulate the shape.</p><p>Girdles, massage may be helpful to optimize shape outcome. (Michele A. Shermak, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Swelling and Firmness After flank Liposuction</strong></p><p>The initial swelling should subside within the first two weeks. There could be residual swelling that may last an additional one to two months. It is important to follow through with your surgeon to ensure that this swelling is not due to fluid retention.</p><p>If you are experiencing fluid retention the surgeon must drain it. If the areas that were treated are feeling firm to touch, it could be a result of tissue swelling which can be alleviated with massage and time.</p><p>However if this firmness does not go away, you should consult your plastic surgeon for a potential secondary liposuction procedure. (Saeed Marefat, MD, Washington DC Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It takes an average of 1 to 3 months for the swelling to go down after liposuction of the flanks. Depending on how much fat was removed, the general health of the patient, their genetics and how aggressive the liposuction was are some of the factors that can prolong the recovery period.</p><p>In certain cases patients choose to combine liposuction procedures with post-op lymphatic massages. Lymphatic massages will help mobilize the stored fluids into the lymphatic system, therefore speeding up the healing process and allowing for a smoother result from the surgery. (Mel T. Ortega, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Swelling takes some time to all go away after liposuction. Most of the swelling tends to go away in the first 1-2 months and a residual amount may take 6-12 months to fully go away depending on the amount of liposuction done, type of liposuction, and the area of liposuction. (Remus Repta, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>At my Cleveland area plastic surgery practice, all my VASER Lipo patients undergo post-procedure massage, which helps with swelling, speeds healing and deals with some of the potenial lumps that some patients will get even with the best technique.</p><p>Everyone heals differently, but, as other surgeons have suggested, it will be months before all the swelling has gone down. In the meantime, drink lots of water to flush toxins and check with your board certified plastic surgeon about massage in the areas treated.<br>
(Paul Vanek, MD, Cleveland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>When I perform Liposuction of the flanks I typically tell patients pre operatively that the swelling should be gone by 6-8 months completely but that I like to see significant results at 3 months. The hips typically look lumpy for 2-3 months but then smooth out in most cases. (Joshua B. Hyman, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
