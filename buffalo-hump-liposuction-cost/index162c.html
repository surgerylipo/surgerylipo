The appearance of this hump brings not only aesthetic problems, but also affects everyday life: blood pressure rises, there is a tightness of movements in the neck and loss of normal sleep.</p><p>The cardinal solution to the problem is liposuction of the neck.</p><h3>How does the cervical hump appear?</h3><p>The buffalo hump represents a large accumulation of adipose tissue in the upper back and is often mis-perceived as a symptom of the curvature of the back. The causes of buffalo hump are:</p><ol>
<li>General obesity;</li>
<li>Hormonal imbalance (Cushing’s disease);</li>
<li>Use of steroids;</li>
<li>Treatment for the immunodeficiency virus (HIV);</li>
<li>Treatment of chronic diseases with the help of steroid medications.</li>
<li>Cervical hump can be one of the manifestations of HIV.</li>

</div><p>Features of the hump are the composition and location. The composition of the formation includes fibrous subcutaneous fat cells that first accumulate, then create a very painful to touch and fairly firm tissue.</p><p>The hump is often located in the inaccessible region of the neck, moreover it can spread to the back of the neck and behind the ears. It is impossible to remove the hump with various exercises and diets.</p><h3>Liposuction the buffalo hump</h3><p>Like any other operation, neck liposuction has several stages: preparation, conduct and recovery.</p><h3>Preparation for surgery</h3><p>The process of preparation for the procedure consists of:</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_9624" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

Through a small tube, a special solution is injected subcutaneously, which under the influence of ultrasound destroys the fat cells, turning them into an emulsion. Specific effects of sound waves can destroy fatty tissue, but do not damage the vessels and nerve fibers.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_9625" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h4>Features of the application of the ultrasonic liposuction method:</h4><ol>
<li>More effectively removes subcutaneous fat on the neck than moist liposuction;</li>
<li>High probability of scalding and scarring of the buffalo skin;</li>
<li>Significant cost of the service;</li>
<li>Only a partial reduction or even remission of the hump.</li>
</ol><h3>Tumescent method</h3><p>With a tumescent procedure, a large amount of anesthetic (lidocaine) is injected into the withers area. Then the surgeon mechanically ruptures fatty clusters and is removed through the injected cannula.</p><h3>Features of wet liposuction:</h3><ul>
<li>Safer than ultrasound (using a micro cannula allows for a spot to remove excess fat);</li>
<li>You can get a large dose of lidocaine (which leads to the appearance of a hypersensitivity reaction or cardiac arrhythmia);</li>
<li>When removing large amounts of fat, fat embolism is possible;</li>
<li>Complete disappearance of the hump and very rare remission of the humerus.</li>
<li>When deciding on a method, give the choice to a specialist, which will increase the chances of a positive result of the operation.</li>

</div><p>Recovery period takes 10-14 days. It is compulsory to wear compression underwear with gaskets that will absorb the remaining liquid flowing from the operating punctures. You should avoid physical activity for 1.5 months after the procedure. The final result is observed after 90 days. Since the withers consist of the largest number of fibrous tissues (compared to other areas of the body), the restoration proceeds quickly and almost painlessly.</p><h3>Contraindications</h3><p>Contraindications to liposuction buffalo hump:</p><ol>
<li>Pregnancy;</li>
<li>Breastfeeding period;</li>
<li>Age to 18 years old;</li>
<li>Allergy to drugs used during the procedure;</li>
<li>Poor blood clotting;</li>
<li>Period of exacerbation of infectious diseases;</li>
<li>Oncological diseases.</li>
</ol><p>The neck ages very quickly and always gives the first age. One of the most common problems is the appearance of a hump in this area. Cope with it through diet and exercise is very difficult. In such a situation, liposuction of the buffalo hump on the neck will help.</p><p>The withers on the neck usually appear in women aged 45-60 years. It is localized in that part of the spine where the cervical section passes into the thoracic. In this place appears a kind of roller. It is called the buffalo hump. This disorder is a local growth of fat deposits in the region of the seventh cervical vertebra. It gradually increases in size and becomes denser. Initially, this violation causes only aesthetic discomfort. It protrudes in the area of the back and can lead to restrictions when choosing clothes. However, gradually this tissue leads to constriction of blood vessels, which prevents normal blood circulation.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_9628" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>This causes atherosclerosis and the appearance of unpleasant symptoms. These include tinnitus, dizziness, headaches. A person can deteriorate memory and concentration of attention.</p><p>In addition, the hump often affects the entire neck and occipital region. As a consequence, there is insomnia, there are violations of breathing in sleep. After a while, the head becomes unnatural.</p><h3>CAUSES OF APPEARANCE</h3><p>Notable symptoms of the hump on the neck appear in the second half of human life. However, the prerequisites for its formation appear much earlier.</p><p>The main reason for this is a violation of the balance of hormones.</p><p>The following factors lead to such problems:</p><ul>
<li>climax – provokes an increase in the amount of estrogens that lead to active growth of fat cells;</li>
<li>Itenko-Cushing’s disease is associated with an increased synthesis of glucocorticoids;</li>
<li>use of some potent drugs – for example, for HIV therapy.</li>

</div><p>Additional factors that may lead to a serious increase in body fat include the following:</p><ul>
<li>sedentary work;</li>
<li>lack of load on the shoulders, a decrease in the amplitude of movements in this area as you age;</li>
<li>cervical disease – in particular, osteochondrosis and osteoporosis;</li>
<li>hereditary predisposition – the presence of similar problems in close relatives increases the risk of buffalo on the neck.</li>
</ul><p>It is important to remember that similar formations in the neck region can be a consequence of the deposition of salts and curvature of the spine. However, in this case, fat deposits do not appear, and therefore the methods of treatment should be different.</p><h3>What is the relationship with cervical osteochondrosis?</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_9630" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>To establish the relationship between withers on the neck and cervical osteochondrosis, one must understand the mechanism of this problem:</p><p>The development of pathology begins with the defeat of the muscular tissue of the collar region – it is above the shoulders and in the neck. As a consequence, a woman develops osteochondrosis.</p><p>After that, in the region of the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae, blood circulation is disrupted and lymphatic exchange worsens. As a result, fat and connective tissues proliferate. Fat deposits are more characteristic for those women who are used to lead a sedentary lifestyle.</p><p>Initially, this problem is an exclusively cosmetic defect. Its further development depends on the rate of progression of cervical osteochondrosis.</p><p>In advanced cases, in addition to the aesthetic problem, pain and vascular syndrome occur.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_9631" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><h3>SYMPTOMS</h3><p>The appearance of the hump on the neck is usually accompanied by such manifestations:</p><ol>
<li>crunch when rotating head;</li>
<li>pain in the occipital region and neck;</li>
<li>tingling, numbness, burning in the affected area;</li>
<li>weakness of the upper limbs;</li>
<li>dizziness.</li>
</ol><h4>The effectiveness of buffalo hump liposuction</h4><p>With the help of liposuction, you can completely get rid of fat deposits in this zone and achieve a more smooth contour of the neck and back.</p><p>This makes it possible to choose normal clothes. For people who have been forced to restrict movement activity due to the appearance of such a hump, this can be a significant relief.</p><h3>TYPES OF PROCEDURE</h3><p>According to the results of the clinical examination, which is carried out at the consultation stage, various methods of liposuction can be proposed to remove the buffalo hump.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_9632" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>Most often an ultrasound or tumescent procedure is performed. Ultrasonic liposuction is a surgical procedure that is used to remove superficial and deep fat deposits. With its help it is possible to cope with large volumes of deposits.</p><p>It is especially useful to apply this method of liposuction to get rid of fat from fibrous zones, which includes buffalo hump. Such liposuction involves the use of ultrasound energy, which is guided through the cannula, placed in the subcutaneous adipose tissue. After inserting the needle, a special liquid is injected into the treated zone.</p><p>Due to the application of ultrasound, it is possible to make fat more liquid and fragment its cells. Due to this, the cellular content enters the intercellular zone. Due to the combination of interstitial fluid, triglycerides and the injected preparation, a stable emulsion is formed, which is extracted from the skin by means of vacuum suction.</p><p>Due to the specificity of sound waves, selective destruction of adipose tissue cells is possible, but without affecting the connective tissue. It is also possible to avoid the defeat of nerves and blood vessels.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_9633" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The ultrasound procedure is considered more effective in the fibrous-fat tissue, of which the withers on the neck are composed, in comparison with the standard surgical procedure. However, in this case, the risk of burns or other lesions of the skin is significantly increased. As a consequence, scar changes are often formed on the neck.</p><p>Tumescent liposuction is also very effective. Since fat deposits in the buffalo hump region have a fibrous structure, large cannulas are very problematic. In this case, the use of microcannons in combination with tumescent technique allows successfully to solve this problem.</p><p>This type of surgery is considered safer than ultrasound liposuction. In this case, a lot of diluted anesthetic solution is injected into the problem zone. As a consequence, the introduction of fluid leads to edema of fatty deposits. Due to their expansion the cannulas move more smoothly and allow getting rid of fat.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_9634" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>Today it is believed that this method provokes much less complications. In this case, experts note that the amount of anesthetic that enters the metabolic processes can not be established. It is important to consider that lidocaine can provoke hypersensitivity. Often as a result of these processes, cardiac arrhythmia develops.</p><p>Complications of such liposuction can also become fat embolism. This is especially true when removing a large amount of fatty deposits. At the same time, the effectiveness of the operation is at a high level – the hump returns after such liposuction only in extreme cases.</p><p>Liposuction of the buffalo hump on the neck refers to popular plastic procedures. The recovery period is quite fast and painless.</p><h3>AVERAGE COST</h3><p>The cost of this surgery depends on the doctor’s qualifications and the scope of the operation. The withers on the neck are quite an unpleasant problem, which can cause health problems. If this can not be removed conservatively, one can resort to liposuction. The main thing is to find a qualified surgeon and clearly follow his recommendations.</p><p>On average, buffalo hump liposuction costs ranging from US $ 2,500 and above.</p><h3>Doctors Opinions</h3><p>The cost of liposuction varies according to geographical areas of the country. Dallas, New York, and California tend to be more expensive areas and even in these areas the cost varies. You certainly want to be cost conscious in your search and compare, but just be sure to compare apples to apples.</p><p>Liposuction is a true art and in many ways is more challenging that many other surgeries. Attention to detail is critical. Make sure you compare prices between surgeons of comparable training and experience. In my part of the country $2000 per site is a usual surgeon’s fees, not counting OR and anesthesia costs.</p><p>A site includes love handles, hips, lateral thighs, back, medial thighs, buffalo hump, etc…and includes both sides as a single site. The abdomen usually counts as 1 1/2 sites. (Jay Burns, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction costs have many variables associated with it. I will break it down as follows.</p><ol>
<li>
<strong>Surgeon costs</strong>: this depends on the number of sites treated during the session. Generally, you receive a price break after a few sites. This also is determined by whether or not you need a position change to treat the areas.</li>
<li>
<strong>Anesthesia costs</strong>: can be a set fee or variable to account for the number of sites or if any other surgery is being done</li>
<li>
<strong>Operating room fees</strong>: Priced by procedure and whether or not you need more supplies ie drapes if there is a position change</li>
<li>
<strong>Technology costs</strong>: VASER, SLIMLIPO, BODYJET, et al The addition of the latest and greatest comes with additional costs.</li>
</ol><p>I believe that it is unfair to quote prices out of the blue because liposuction is SURGERY even if it is being performed without ANESTHESIA. Ideally, patients should be close to their goal weight and be otherwise healthy.</p><p></p>

</div>Abdominal liposuction patients need to be carefully evaluated for hernias should there be any history of abdominal surgery and or history of hernias. If I am performing multiple procedures, I will generally discount the cost of the additional procedures, likewise for the other costs.
<p>The pricing is dependent on the surgeon, anesthesia provider, and the operating facility. </p><p>I am sorry not to provide you with specific numbers, but I truly feel it is a disservice to quote numbers for this procedure without the benefit of establishing a physician patient relationship for this very variable procedure. (Stephen M. Chen, MD, Richmond Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction cost and fees in Los Angeles varies depending on how many body areas are liposuctioned. There is also associated cost of surgery center fees and anesthesiologist. Obviously, the cost of liposuction is important, but it should not be the most important factor in choosing a plastic surgeon who specializes in liposuction.</p><p>liposuction results are ultimately the most important. there is also difference between types of liposuction such as laser, vaser, etc. (Sean Younai, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of a liposuction would typically depend on the number of areas to be treated, duration of the surgery, under local / GA, the area of practice (downtown/suburb, state, country), type of liposuction (SAL,PAL,Vibro, VASER, etc.),the experience, & frankly even the whim of the operating surgeon at times. We perform VASER lipo at our clinic & the basic procedure costs at our clinic (Mumbai, India) usually start of at approx. 2000-2500 US$.</p><p>Yes, a discounted price comes up when more areas are addressed during a single procedure as the ancillary costs are cut down. Remember, costs & discounts are secondary, the most important thing would be to look for a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon who you are comfortable with, to do the procedure for you.
