</div><p>However, that be said, the majority of doctors performing this procedure are not board certified plastic surgeons.</p><p>The problem arises when there are complications from the treatment. Who is going to be referred the patient to treat the complication?</p><p>Most likely the plastic surgeon. I suggest you go to someone that is well qualified and that you know has good results. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Go to a Plastic Surgeon – not a Dermatologist</h5><p>There are vast differences in the training of doctors who perform liposuction. Because it is viewed as an “easy” procedure to learn, many non-plastic surgeons perform this operation. Make no mistake about this – liposuction is an OPERATION, not just a PROCEDURE.</p><p>As such it should be done by someone who has full Board Certified training (5 to 8 years after medical school) in the practice of surgery and specifically in Plastic Surgery.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6211" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a93e47936855586b15a8f8c34ed2c8df">

</div><p>Only in this way can you be truly cared for in the safest way and only a properly trained plastic surgeon can help you best avoid complications but also would know what to do if they occurred.</p><p>A Dermatologist is an expert in the care and diagnosis of skin conditions and has in no way the training of a plastic surgeon. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Although many specialties say that they perform liposuction safely, I believe that a plastic surgeon is the best qualified to perform liposuction. During plastic surgery training, residents are instructed and taught how to do liposuction safely.</p><p>No other specialty teaches this procedure in training, and then these other specialties need to do courses or a fellowship to have any training at all.

</div><p><i>Modern Liposuction was actually invented by a DERMATOLOGIST</i></p><p>Tumescent liposuction is the modern liposuction technique that allows liposuction to be performed safely, minimally-invasively, and in an outpatient setting. The modern technique of tumescent lipo- which is the safest form of lipo performed all over the world was ACTUALLY INVENTED BY A DERMATOLOGIST named Dr. Klein from Southern California.</p><p>The incisions made in liposuction are no more than 2 mm deep and no longer than 2 mm wide. Often they don’t even need to be stitched closed. A board certified dermatologist OR plastic surgeon can safely perform this procedure. (Sameer Bashey, MD, Beverly Hills Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Who should be performing your liposuction.</i></p><p>Laws tend to vary from state. In most states, any medical doctor with a license can perform liposuction. However, it is vital that one remembers liposuction is a surgical procedure requiring special training, expertise, and experience.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6213" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Just because any licensed doctor can perform the procedure, does not mean this is the right choice for a given patient. I recommend that patients consult with a board certified plastic surgeon with experience performing liposuction.</p><p>Sometimes it is best to see multiple surgeons to determine which one is right for you. (Kelly Gallego, MD, FACS, Yuba City Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Any licensed doctor can legally do liposuction so watch out.</strong></p><p>In Georgia, after internship and passage of the boards, doctors are permitted to perfom legally “medicine and surgery”. So although it is legal, it is not necessarily good or even ethical. I would recommend a board certified plastic surgeon (after all, liposuction is surgery) who performs it regularly. (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><amp-img class="size-medium wp-image-6214 amp-wp-unknown-size amp-wp-unknown-width amp-wp-unknown-height amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2017/09/index.html" alt="Surgery Liposuction, Tummy Tuck (Abdominoplasty) By Dr. Tom J.

Liposuction was not really a safe procedure, before dermatologist J. Klein invented tumescent liposuction. Go to the doctor you feel comfortable with. (Robert Kasten, MD, Mainz Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Unfortunately, many doctors call themselves liposuction specialist when they are not even a plastic surgeon. A doctor might be able to learn how to do simple liposuciton with short training, outside a qualified residency program, but they would not certianly have the debth of training and knowledge to handle problems and questions adequately.</p><p>You would’nt take your car to any mechanic! you might want to also be deligent about how is going to perform surgery on you.

</div><p>Therefore, I recommend a board certified plastic surgeon, at a minimum. (Sean Younai, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Liposuction Specialists</strong></p><p>I would recommend getting a Liposuction procedure only by a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon. Check the American Society of Plastic Surgery (ASPS) or American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS) for board certified plastic surgeons in your area.</p><p>This ensures your physician has proper training, experience, and technical skills required for a safe and effective outcome. Unfortunately, there are many practitioners performing liposuction without proper credentials. Do your homework and research before agreeing to have surgery.</p><p>Going to a weekend course for liposuction is not sufficient, and it gets very confusing when a “doctor” claims to be something he or she isn’t.

</div><p><em>Top Liposuction Expert – Checking credentials of your surgeon</em></p><p>Liposuction is a surgical procedure that requires expertise and meticulous attention to detail. The long term consequences of poorly performed liposuction can be life-altering. Thus, it is always wise to check out your surgeon’s credentials and make sure they are a diplomate of the American Board of Plastic Surgery. (Raffy Karamanoukian, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Its simple-Receive your plastic surgery from a board-certified plastic surgeon</h3><p>Liposuction is a popular and effective way to contour the body. Although there are many practitioners that are offering liposuction, only plastic surgeons have received the proper education and training in these procedures during their residency.</p><p>A board-certified plastic surgeon is a specialist with 3 to 6 years of experience in training in just plastic surgery. They have also taken written and oral exams and their practices have been reviewed and evaluated by the American Board of Plastic Surgery.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6217" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>Keep in mind that cosmetic surgery is still surgery and an invasive procedure. Keep your health and safety foremost in your mind. Received a safe and beautiful result by only working with a board-certified plastic surgeon who will have the experience, knowledge, and commitment to your safety. (Pat Pazmino, MD, FACS, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Board certified? In what? </b></p><p>Any doctor can take a weekend course and buy the equipment to start performing liposuction. However, this doesn’t make them qualified to perform liposuction safely on you. Even claims of “board certified” can be deceiving.</p><p>You should ask, board certified in what? Your doctor may be board certified in family practice, OBGYN, emergency medicine or any of a dozen other specialties. Look for a doctor certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery to be confident that they have had the proper training and experience to perform liposuction safely and effectively to achieve the best results for you. (Adam Hamawy, MD, Princeton Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Liposuction should be performed by a plastic surgeon. Its NOT so easy that a caveman can do it.</h5><p>Liposuction is a very popular procedure and is advertised and performed by non-plastic surgeons including family practitioners, internists, gynecologists and ENT doctors. To confuse matters there are multiple less invasive technologies that these physicians have been utilizing to market themselves, including laser lipo.</p><p>Liposuction is relatively less invasive than most other procedures and therefore is enticing for the non-trained physician, however there are very real complications including perforation of organs, blood clots, fat emboli, drug toxicity, and the more mild contour deformities and skin injuries.</p><p>With that being said it is not part of most physicians training to do liposuction, nor is part of their training to handle the complications. Be careful, its not that easy and there are many finesse techniques which separate standard liposuction from advanced liposuction! You should start by reviewing your plastic surgeons qualifications and making sure they are board certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery.</p><p>That would be the initial starting point to finding the right plastic surgeon for you. (Andrew P. Trussler, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Any doctor can legally do liposuction. But most probably should not.</h4><p>Liposuction is a relatively straight-forward surgical procedure. However, a brief review of recent adverse medical events in your community will show that there are some poorly trained liposuction providers out there that are hurting patients.</p><p>These physicians have circumvented the usual route of residency and fellowship training in plastic surgery and have started doing liposuction without bothering to learn techniques that might be better alternatives (tummy tucks, arm lifts etc.)</p><p>Avoid physicians that advertise themselves as ‘cosmetic surgeons’ and seek out a board certified ASPS member plastic surgeon for your body contouring consultation.
