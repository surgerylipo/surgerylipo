The main factor leading to the emergence of the second chin is genetics, it depends on the parents who will have a double chin, so it can manifest in very thin people. The second important factor is overweight.</p><p>The formation of jowls, sagging cheeks leads to a change in the contour of the face, and this is one of the main signs of age-related changes. You can smooth out all the wrinkles, bring the skin in perfect condition, but the face contour will definitely show your age.</p><p>There is a huge number of non-surgical, little effective, temporary techniques to reduce the second chin. Each time patients tell similar stories, that I have 10 ultrasound cavitations, 10 cryodestructions, do exercises and chin massage spent a lot of money, but I do not see the effect.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6542" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-f19c4ee415e49d8539c46bef1e0699a5">

</div><h3>How to Get Rid of a Double Chin and Jowls? -Tumescent liposuction</h3><p>In these cases, the most effective, low-traumatic procedure is a syringe tumescent micro liposuction of the chin, cheeks, jowls and neck.</p><p>The procedure is so low-traumatic that patients can go to work the next day. Unlike laser or ultrasound liposuction, it does not give complications in the form of subcutaneous scar formation (beautifully called “new collagen”) and burns.</p><h3>How is the liposuction performed?</h3><p>Syringe tumescent micro liposuction is performed under local anesthesia. </p><p>A solution consisting of physiological solution, anesthetic and epinephrine is preliminarily injected through the punctures of the atraumatic cannula into the zone of excess fat.</p><p>It is evenly distributed in the tissues, causing a strong constriction of the blood vessels, capillaries and swelling of the adipocytes, as a result of which the aspiration process is much easier. After that, the doctor enters the syringe into the place of accumulation of fat, and with the help of a piston pulls it out.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6544" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-34995e66c422e6d315276f7e9f6196f4">

</div><p>This is a neat and low-traumatic procedure, requiring at the same time jewelry skill. The tumescent-syringe method is good for a short recovery period, bruises and swelling are absent or disappear quickly enough. In addition, the surgeon strictly controls every stage, every milliliter of fat, using thin cannulas, so he achieves optimal precise modeling, which is inaccessible to hardware techniques.</p><h3>Removal of the lumps of Bichat</h3><p>In aesthetic medicine, the removal of the lumps of Bichat is becoming very popular. Bisch lumps are located between chewing and buccal muscles, forming an additional volume of the lower part of the face. </p><p>This operation makes it possible to get rid of the pronounced roundness of the cheeks and to give more expressive and refined outlines to the face, especially to its lower parts.</p><p></p>

</div>Surgery to reduce the cheeks is performed under local anesthesia. All manipulations are carried out from the inside of the cheeks, so the scars on the face can not be feared. Fat lumps are removed through a small incision, after which stitches are applied.
<p>Bichat lumps have an interesting feature: with age they significantly decrease themselves. Therefore, it is not advisable to remove the lumps of Bichat after 35 years old- this makes you visually older. </p><p>At the age of 35 years, it makes sense to reduce the jowls (located below the lumps of Bichat). Remove the second chin, reduce the cheeks and remove the jowls in our time is no problem! Immediately after the procedure, the effect is seen, which is amplified during the first months. Features of lipolytic correction of the face or what is the liposuction of the cheeks and the second chin.</p><p>Liposuction of the cheeks and “second chin” is a minimally invasive surgical operation, which is aimed at removing part of the adipose tissue from the chin zone and cheeks. Removal of fat in the face area is rarely performed as a separate operation.</p><p>Local accumulations of fat cells under the influence of gravity sag down, which adversely affects the tone and elasticity of the facial skin fibers, so most surgeons perform it in conjunction with a face lift or are considered as one of the stages of neck plasty (plastismoplasty).</p><p>About how to remove fat from the chin conceives almost every person after the age of 45 years, because over time the elasticity of the skin fibers decreases, the skin under the influence of gravity sags down and in the chin area there is the appearance of “fat traps”. However, sometimes liposuction of the “second chin” is required and people at a young age who suffer from excess weight, metabolic disorders in the body or have a hereditary predisposition to the formation of local fat deposits in the face area.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6547" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>Specialists recommend that attention be paid to the fact that the operations aimed at reducing the volume of the fatty tissue of the cheeks (liposuction) and removing the Bichat lumps (the fatty body that is located slightly below the zygomatic bone) represent different types of surgical manipulation, because in the first case the surgeon removes part of the fat through a small skin puncture, and in the second there is a complete removal of the fatty body from the cheek.</p><p>The term “liposuction of jowls”, which is often found among clients of aesthetic surgery clinics, is not present in the environment of plastic surgeons, because “jowls” are sagging areas of the skin in the cheek and chin that break the normal contour of the face.</p><p></p>

</div>They can be removed only by surgical tightening of the skin, and the procedure aimed at removing part of the adipose tissue in this case will be an additional step in carrying out tightening in order to obtain the most pronounced results.
<h3>Types of chin and jowl liposuction</h3><p>There are several types of surgery to remove the “second” chin – tumescent liposuction, laser, radiofrequency and ultrasound.</p><h3>Ultrasonic and laser liposuction</h3><p>Ultrasonic and laser methods for removing local fat deposits on the face are rarely used today because they are based on the destruction of the fat cell membrane by exposing them to a certain type of high-intensity radiation (laser or ultrasound) that contributes to the temperature increase of the tissues and can cause burns.</p><h3>Radiofrequency liposuction</h3><p>Radiofrequency liposuction acts according to a similar principle (radiofrequency impulses penetrate the depth of subcutaneous fat and cause its heating). The equipment by which it is carried out is equipped with an automatic system for monitoring the heating power of the skin and constant monitoring of the internal temperature, which makes the operation as safe as possible for the patient.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6549" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>The duration of the operation depends on the volume of adipose tissue that must be removed and the surgical procedures (on average, liposuction lasts from 30 minutes to 1.5 hours).</p><p>It is performed under local anesthesia, so the patient is conscious and can sense a feeling of bursting in the correction zone. Immediately after the liposuction of the chin, a fixative bandage is applied, which must be worn for 10 days.</p><p>Eat solid foods, visit the pool, sauna, or engage in heavy physical labor for two weeks after surgery is not recommended.</p><p>The preliminary result of the correction is evaluated after 10-14 days, the final result after 3-4 months.</p><p>Negative consequences after liposuction of the chin occur rarely, but sometimes immediately after surgery in the correction zone there is swelling and the patient feels pain.</p><h3>Estimated cost of the operation</h3><p>The price of “second chin” liposuction depends on the qualification of the surgeon who will do it, and the location of the clinic for aesthetic surgery. According to experts, liposuction of the cheeks, chin and neck is considered one of the safest surgical procedures in aesthetic surgery.</p><p>It practically does not cause complications and gives a pronounced, quick result, which can be evaluated immediately after the end of the recovery period.</p></div>
