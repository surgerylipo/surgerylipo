<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><h3>How is inner thigh fat removal performed?</h3><p>Liposuction of the hips is aimed at improving the shape and contours of the body. Fat deposits in the thighs and buttocks – this is a typical phenomenon for most women.</p><p>Even slender women often have stretch marks on the inside of the thighs, which spoils the overall appearance of the skin and body shape.</p><p>To cope with such problems allows such a procedure.</p><h3>The essence of the procedure</h3><p>The essence of surgical intervention is to extract excess layers of fat. The procedure is performed under local anesthesia or general anesthesia.</p><p>Depending on the complexity of the operation, liposuction can last from half an hour to several hours.</p><p>First, the doctor makes a special marking with the marker, the zones are extracted from which the fat will be removed, then they are disinfected, and afterwards the surgeon starts the immediate operation.</p><p>Liposuction can be carried out as a separate procedure, and in conjunction with other cosmetic manipulations. This is an excellent method of removing the fat layer, but a good result can be achieved mainly in those patients who have elastic skin. If the elasticity is markedly reduced, the operation can cause further cosmetic problems.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_9905" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h3>PREPARATION</h3><p>Preparation for the procedure takes place in several stages:</p><p>Conversation with a plastic surgeon. The patient should have a clear idea of which procedure he agrees to. All questions and doubts should be eliminated at this particular, initial stage.</p><p>1-3 weeks before surgery. Before performing liposuction, the patient is required to take tests and tell the surgeon about all the diseases or allergies that are present.<br>
The patient must provide his medical card and receive the necessary recommendations.</p><p>On the day of surgery, it is prohibited to eat and drink eight hours before the procedure.</p><h3>Recommendations before surgery.</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_9906" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

<li>It should be reported about all the medications taken and all the allergic reactions that have ever happened.</li>
<li>Stop taking anticoagulants (drugs that promote blood thinning).</li>
<li>Follow the diet, do not eat heavy meals, reduce the amount of salt consumed.</li>
<li>Limit yourself in taking alcohol and cigarettes.</li>
</ol><h3>Required tests</h3><p>There are a number of tests that all patients must take, without exception, before the operation:</p><ul>

</ul><h3>There are several methods of liposuction:</h3><h4>Standard Liposuction</h4><p>This procedure does not provide for expensive equipment and expensive drugs. It has two modifications: dry and wet. The first is a clinical version using cannulas. It involves creating small incisions and inserting into the subcutaneous space a cannula with one or more apertures at the end.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_9907" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>The diameter of such a cannula directly depends on the volume of fat removed and the surgeon’s personal preferences. At the present time, the cannula with a diameter of up to 0.5 cm is considered to be the least traumatic. While one end of the cannula is submerged in the subcutaneous area, the other end is attached to a vacuum device that creates a negative pressure. It is this last factor that allows to remove fat.</p><p>It should be noted immediately that this method is considered the most traumatic and outdated. During the operation, there is a great damage to the subcutaneous tissues and the corresponding blood loss. Wet liposuction differs from dry only in that the area of the operation is pre-treated with an anesthetic.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_9908" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><h3>Tumescent liposuction</h3><p>This method is the most popular and popular. Unlike standard liposuction, it causes less injuries and shortens the recovery period. Its essence lies in the preliminary infiltration of the zone of operation with a special Klein solution, which contains lidocaine, epinephrine and saline. After infiltration takes about forty minutes, the fat tissue “diluted” and subsequently easier to remove.</p><p><strong>Strengthened (oscillatory)</strong></p><p>This option is a classic view, but the used cannula has a special manipulator, which makes it possible to create reciprocating movements with a frequency of 200 movements per minute.</p><h3>Ultrasonic liposuction</h3><p>This procedure destroys fat cells under the influence of ultrasound (not as a consequence of mechanical action, as in the classical case). During the procedure, incisions are made to the skin, through which a special probe transmitting ultrasonic waves is inserted. They destroy the fat tissue, and the destroyed fiber is sucked through the cannula.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_9909" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h3>Laser liposuction</h3><p>This method differs from the usual one in that in this case the laser energy is used, which is fed through a thin needle (one millimeter in diameter). It moves and in the process of movement and tears, burns all the excess fat cells.</p><h3>This procedure has its advantages:</h3><ol>
<li>it is not very traumatic;</li>
<li>lasts not more than one hour;</li>
<li>compresses collagen fibers, which leads to radical skin-tightening from the inside;</li>
<li>reduces the risk of complications;</li>
<li>reduces the recovery period.</li>
</ol><p>Most often, the procedure is assigned to those who have large fat deposits, especially in hard-to-reach and intimate areas. The best results it gives in small areas and in the face area. Sometimes this type of liposuction is used to smooth the surface of the body after removing a large amount of fat in other ways.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_9910" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d8ace6a67b21721f2ef7d633adea7cca">

</ol><h3>SIDE EFFECTS AND CONSEQUENCES</h3><p><strong>The following side effects are possible:</strong></p><p>Disturbance of skin sensitivity. This is not so rare, because as the destruction of fat tissue affects nerve fibers and blood vessels. Thus, there are areas of paresthesia and hypoesthesia, which persist for several months.</p><p>Uneven contours. If inner thigh fat removal was not carried out at the most professional level, and adipose tissue was removed unevenly, then the appearance of seals and depressions may occur.<br>
Liposuction is performed due to the application of microscopic incisions and punctures. Accordingly, it can lead to suppuration, swelling, bruising, inflammation, which in turn leads to the appearance of scars.</p><p>Fat embolism and thromboembolism. This complication is serious, as the occlusion of the vessel with a fat embolus occurs, and such a phenomenon can lead to a fatal outcome. The latter, fortunately, is unlikely, but the very side effect is quite common. Pain syndrome. This side effect is the norm, the wounds will and should be sore, but pain medications can always come to the rescue.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_9912" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>Sagging of the skin. This is also normal, as the volume of fat tissue decreases sharply, but the area of the skin does not decrease. This problem can be easily eliminated when wearing compression garment.</p><h3>RECOVERY PERIOD</h3><p>After liposuction, the first six to eight hours after the patient is carefully monitored. Two or three days after the procedure, it is better to stay in the clinic. The doctor prescribes antibiotics to avoid the development of pathogenic microflora and individual drugs that help improve the regenerative processes of the skin. At first, after liposuction, pain and fever are possible, but these side effects quickly pass. Discomfort can be felt for a month, as it is required to wear special compression underwear.</p><h3>DURATION OF THE EFFECT</h3><p>The final result becomes noticeable six months after the procedure, and its duration is another plus operation. The number of fat cells is determined at the genetic level. In the process of life, they either increase, or decrease in size, but never disappear.</p><p>Liposuction also removes them forever. Thus, a person who leads a healthy and active lifestyle will keep the result obtained for years to come. And in order to facilitate the rehabilitation period, the following recommendations are given:</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_9913" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">
