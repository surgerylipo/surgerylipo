Endermology or massages help a lot to smooth out the areas faster. (David Hansen, MD, Beverly Hills Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>The lumpiness felt early on after liposuction occurs in almost all except the most conservative liposuction cases.</p><p>It is a result of the mechanical disruption of an originally thicker and compact fatty layer with a thinner fatty layer that is looser, swollen, and may have palpable nodules of fat in it.</p><p>As the suctioned area heals and the swelling subsides the lumpiness usually improves. Post-liposuction massages can help with this, also.</p><p>However, if the liposuction is done too aggressively or with poor technique, the lumpiness may be permanent.

</div><p><strong>Liposculpture usually leaves some temporary lumps and bumps</strong></p><p>With liposuction/liposculpture, there are two different typs of lumps/bumps. The first type is temporary and is due to uneven resolution of swelling, which produces the high and low points that create the lumps and bumps.</p><p>Sometimes these lumps are visible, and sometimes they are just palpable as firm areas. In my experience, this happens nearly all the time, and resolves over about 3-6 months, and sometimes even longer. I have observed this using traditional lipo, tumescent lipo, UAL, Vaser, PAL.</p><p>Compression garments do help this however. The second type of lump is less frequent and more problematic. This is due to either over resection or under resection of fat. After the swelling resolves, a high point remains, and will need a secondary liposuction procedure to correct. (Scott E. Kasden, MD, FACS, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4901" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h3>There may be small lumps at first but end results should look smooth.</h3><p>During the liposculpture process, some of the fat that is not removed can get damaged. These become tiny hard lumps that the body eventually eliminates on its own. Post-surgical swelling will also disguise your final results initially, and takes time to dissipate.</p><p>A compression garment will help with this. However, your overall appearance after lipo should not be lumpy or bumpy if the procedure is performed by a board certified plastic surgeon with plenty of experience in body sculpting. (Glenn M. Davis, MD, FACS, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction is a very popular and effective technique for body contouring. After this procedure, patients should expect a healing process where they will have swelling, bruising, minimal drainage, and some uneven results. This is because each part of the body heals a little differently.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4902" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-5c2b43db30d37388c501e254aa351542">

</div><p>During this process, patients are encouraged to elevate the area has been treated as much as possible, limit the salt intake in their diet, and to wear their compression garment as much as possible. You should expect to see your final results from a liposuction 6 to 8 months after your surgery. (Pat Pazmino, MD, FACS, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Irregularities Following Liposuction</h4><p>Liposuction is not a perfect science, and some contour irregularity is common. There are several specific techniques that are used to avoid these deformities, but in general, overly aggressive liposuction (in particular the use of SmartLipo by non-plastic surgeons) can yield significant depressions that can be quite disfiguring.</p><p>In some cases, depressions from liposuction can be treated with fat grafting. With careful planning, the love handles (flanks) and lower abdomen can be treated with standard liposuction to yield exceptional results. (Adam J. Oppenheimer, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4903" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-07ae121aa7dd4bff790c0c876e6cda10">

</div><p><b>It IS possible to have a smooth liposuction result!</b></p><p>First of all, it is important to understand that ALL liposuction involves the passage of cannulas through the fatty tissue layer for removal of fat under vacuum. This includes SMARTLIPO, COOL Lipo, Pro Lipo, Slim Lipo, VASER lipo, Tumescent liposuction, liposculpture, BODY JET lipo and any other you have heard of… THEY ARE ALL TECHNIQUES FOR LIPOSUCTION.</p><p>So understanding that, please also know that the results from ANY liposuction procedure will depend on several things: The quality and quantity of your skin.</p><p>No matter what you are told, NO liposuction technique will make poor quality skin that is in excess go away.</p><p>The amount removed. The technique of the provider- which is in turn dependent on the education, training, and experience of that provider.

</div><h4>Lumpy after Lipo</h4><p>Skin irregularities can occur after liposculpture and final results often don’t occur for 3-6 weeks. However, uneven fat removal can result in contour irregularities that are long standing. I do tell patients that from about 2 weeks to 2 months after treatment the skin can feel firm, called “induration.” This softens and is an expected sequela following lipo. (Melanie D. Palm, MD – Account Suspended, San Diego Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Post-Lipo Lumps</b></p><p>Lumpiness due to fluid collection is normal after liposuction. So expect to feel bumps under the skin in the areas treated, usually for 4 – 6 weeks. What I recommend is massaging the lumpy areas and wearing a compression garment.</p><p>The cannula used during the liposuction procedure creates tunnels as it suctions out fat. A compression garment helps collapse these tunnels, thereby preventing them from filling up with fluid, which causes bumps. It would take 3 – 6 months to see optimal results.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4905" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>At that time, the bumpiness should have resolved to produce a smooth, more slender and contoured body profile. Still, based on their severity, your doctor may recommend you augment the healing and smoothing process with Lymphatic Drainage Massage and/or Lipolaser for spot fat reduction in areas that may have been missed. (Hal Michael Bass, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Surface irregularities are a known possibility with liposculpture. Even without any surgery, fat tends to be lumpy. While poor surgical technique can leave exaggerated hills and valleys, even the best surgeon with the best technique will have surface irregularities in at least some patients because fat grows in lumps, called lobules.</p><p>The abdomen, with its flexible skin, is more prone to visible lumps than the love handles. Again, that’s true even without surgery. (Heather J. Furnas, MD, Santa Rosa Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4906" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>Liposuction lumpiness is technique dependent and doctor dependent. Also right skin and fat composition is prerequisite for excellent results. This is based on patient selection and having right judgement in performing the procedure. (Afshin Farzadmehr, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Whether or not it is lumpy in the first 6 months is somewhat immaterial if the ultimate outcome is smooth. I would not plan for lumpiness, but it is possible early after surgery. (Gary Lawton, MD, FACS, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Liposuction and indentations in the skin – Los Angeles</h5><p>Careful liposuction can produce amazing results. I perform liposuction under general anesthesia to minimize pain and discomfort during the procedure. This allows for meticulous technique. (Raffy Karamanoukian, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Irregularity after Liposuction</i></p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4907" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-6aaa92a21cd6736f863e7ba688b56fd0">

</div><p>Although irregularity (” lumpiness”) can be seen temporarily or permanently after liposuction surgery it should not be “common”. There are some technical maneuvers that should be performed to minimize the risks of irregularities. (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Liposculpture may produce bumps for several months</h5><p>In my experience using tumescent technique, microcannulas, and laser assisted liposculpture such as smartlipo reduces the frequency and severity of lumpiness after a liposculpture procedure. (Edward Lack, MD, Chicago Dermatologist)</p><h4>Experience is Key</h4><p>A well performed liposuction should not turn lumpy. Lumpiness occurs when the doctor does not remove fate in even thickness.</p><ul>
<li>Lump = Too much fat left behind</li>
<li>Dent = Too much fat removed</li>
</ul><p>*However, if the skin is very loose and flabby the chances of lumpiness are increased. (Ivan Thomas, MD (retired), Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4908" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-75d7779810e09cf26a6cf84d51e552cc">

</div><p><b>Liposculpture (lipoSUCTION) should not make you “lumpy”</b></p><p>You may have scar tissue that you can feel beneath your skin for a few months after liposuction, but you should not have a lumpy appearance once you are healed. (Carmen Kavali, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Minimizing lumps after liposuction, liposculpturing</h4><p>The key is for your liposuction surgeon to utilize smaller cannula. If the procedure is completed in a couple hours, under general anesthesia, you most likely had larger cannula utilized during liposuction for the expediency of the surgeon.</p><p>You may want to consider tumescent liposuction under mild sedation and make sure your liposuction surgeon utilize smaller cannula and spend more time ensuring a smoother liposculpturing. New generation of external ultrasound devices such as Vaser Shape or Liposonix can be utilized post-op to minimize post-liposuction unevenness. (William Ting, MD, Bay Area Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Smooth Skin after Liposculpture</i></p><p>The cosmetic outcome of Liposculpture varies from surgeon to surgeon. A more experienced surgeon is less likely to have a result with lumpy skin than a less experienced surgeon. During liposuction fat is removed not as an even paste or liquid, but as fat globules.</p><p>As such, it does leave some irregularity. When the liposuction is not very aggressive or when only deep layers of fat are removed, this resulting irregularity is not noticeable. However if the surgeon is very aggressive in removing a lot of fat and fat close to the skin surface, then you will likely have some lumpiness to your skin.</p><p>Massage right after surgery, and continuing it for about 3 months will help to smooth out these lumps, although some irregularity may remain. (Martin Jugenburg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Final results after liposculpture can take 3 – 6 months, but lumpiness doesn’t usually last that long</i></p><p>The amount of swelling you have depends on several factors including the amount of fat you have removed, wearing a post-operative compression garment, and the degree of trauma sustained during the procedure.</p><p>In most cases, though, there is hardly any lumpiness from swelling left after six weeks on the abdomen and hips and even less time for other areas. (Lawrence Osman, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Lumps after liposuction</b></p><p>Liposuction, lipoplasty, and liposculpture are all words for the same thing, just some sound more elegant than others. The lumps are dependent on the areas done, the nature of the patient’s tissue, and the experience and training of the doctor doing it.</p><p>The flanks and lower abdomen are generally good areas especially if you have not been pregnant. Most will disappear with gentle massage and time. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How to prevent lumps after Lipo</h3><p>The most important thing is to use very small cannulas. Secondly, I’m a great believer in post operative compression garments plus the use of topifoam pads on the liposuctioned areas. The topifoam pads evenly distribute pressure over the liposuctioned area and help smooth out bumps. (Ricardo L. Rodriguez, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Liposuction works best on those with “tighter” skin tone. Those with loose or hanging skin are rarely happy afterward. Surgeons who look to remove fat aggressively and leave little fat remaining actually lead toward “lumpy” results.</p><p>The tissues of patients who smoke or are otherwise not in the best of health also tend toward lumpy results. How you heal is an issue in any cosmetic surgery result. So as you see it is a combination of patient factors and surgeon technical prowess/philosophy that leads to the quality of a liposuction result. (John P. Di Saia, MD, Orange Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I have been very impressed with how smooth the skin is after laser liposuction using the SlimLipo laser lipo machine. See before and after pictures of laser lipo of tummy at 6 weeks post op below: I would never have tried old time liposuction on such a thin person with so little fat because I would have definitly had contour deformities like skin irregularities, lumps and bumps.</p><p>I only use laser lipo for body sculpting because the laser liquefaction of the fat results in more uniform fat removal and thus smoother skin post liposcutiuon. The skin tightening feature of the laser is excellent.</p><p>I also use the SlimLipo laser lipo to correct skin irregularities and bumps in patients who have had liposculpture with old time laser liposuction. See before and after pictures of laser lipo to smooth skin after traditional liposculpture left skin irregularities on the abdomen.</p><p>In the before picture on the left I have outlined the irregularities with purple lines. In the after picture of laser liposculpture with SlimLipo you can see how the abdominal skin is smoother. (Brooke R. Seckel, MD, FACS, Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
